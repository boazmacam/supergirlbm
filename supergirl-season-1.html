        <h3 style="color:white">Krypton's Death</h3>
        <div class="box" >Kara Zor-El is the last daughter of Krypton. Krypton was one of the most scientifically advanced planets to exist in the galaxy. Their advancements came at a high cost. They used and harvested power from their core that helped them obtain great achievements the likes of which the galaxy had never seen. The Kryptonians got greedy and their star became a ticking time bomb. Eventually, their planet exploded and destroyed all other planets in its solar system. Two children of the family of the great House of El were sent in pods that headed a course for Earth. Their parents sent them to this planet because of the yellow sun. The yellow sun will give Kryptonians the power of flight, speed, laser eyes, ice breath, extreme strength, impenetrable flesh, and stop them from gaining weight, fat, or puberty body changes. Jor-El and wife Lara sent their son Kal-El. Zor-El and wife Alura Zor-El sent their daughter Kara. Kal-El was sent first and got to Earth safely. Kara was next and was off but her pod got knocked off coarse and pulled her into a portal to a galactic prison for the galaxy’s worst criminals, the Phantom Zone. Kara was stuck in stasis in the Phantom Zone for 24 years until somehow her pod got loose and landed on Earth, 24 years of sleeping later. Kal-El detected her crash to Earth and found her 24 years old. Kara’s mission was to protect and raise him but he already grew up without her. He no longer needed Kara’s protection. Kal-El grew up as Clark Kent, raised in Smallville. He became a reporter for the Daily Planet and moved to Metropolis. A big crime forced him to reveal himself as a Kryptonian. He was deemed Superman, the Man of Tomorrow, the hero of Metropolis. Clark works as a reporter for the Daily Planet but is also secretly Superman. He had already gone through that by the time Kara had landed and he told her his story. Clark wanted to give Kara the life that he grew up in, a loving family that cares and nurtures for her. He placed her in the care of friends of his named Jeremiah Danvers with wife Eliza Danvers and daughter Alex Danvers. Kara needed a human surname for herself so she changed her last name to Danvers.</div>
        <h3 style="color:white">CatCo in National City</h3>
        <div class="box">Kara and Alex started out terrible to each other, until a crime on a friend forced them to come together and see how good they work together. Since then they have become inseparable. So inseparable that Alex and Kara live in National City in separate lofts but still spend so much time together. Kara works for Cat Grant, the Queen of All Media. Cat is the CEO and founder of CatCo, the main news platform for National City, like the Daily Planet is for Metropolis. Kara works as Cat’s assistant. Basically getting her coffee, following all of her demands, and reserving and cancelling appointments and such for her. Kara uses her powers from time to time for CatCo. She uses her X-Ray Vision mostly to see if something is running out, her Super-Hearing to know if Cat is having a conversation about her or to know when she will be arriving to the company building. She hasn’t flown in over a decade, hasn’t used her Heat-Vision nor her Super-Speed, and has not mastered her Freeze-Breath. She had a friend named Winn Schott who is Cat's IT. They met on the first day that Kara applied for the job to be Cat's assistant. Working at a news outlet, she sees problems happening and things that get out of hand because we can't stop something we don't understand. Still she remains still and waits until this blows over as to not blow her cover and reveal the fact that there is other alien life. Kara has remained faithful to Cat even if Cat is not very appreciative of the work that Kara does for her. Winn helped make this experience a bit more fun for Kara as they are best friends, but he has problems telling her, he loves her. It has been like this for a year, until a problem forced Kara to reveal herself as the second Kryptonian on Earth.</div>
        <h3 style="color:white">Flight 237</h3>
        <div class="box">Another day has passed and Winn finally had enough courage to ask Kara out to dinner. Kara politely declined because she had a blind date tonight. She had called Alex to come to her loft because she needed help picking out what to wear, because she was very nervous about making a good impression. Alex was in a hurry because she had to board Flight 237 to Geneva for work. She told Kara that blue is always the way to go. Kara is now in her blind date and she tries to make good conversation but it does not work. The guy she was on the blind date with excused himself to go to the wash room. Kara used her Super-Hearing on him and she heard him say "check please" and flirted with the waitress asking her to leave with him. Kara was saddened by the fact that her blind date will be ditching her tonight. The news was on in the bar and she had heard that Flight 237 to Geneva has had an engine failure. She knew that Alex was on that flight and she just couldn't bear the thought of losing Alex after all they have been through together. Kara sneaked away into a back alley, removed her jacket, and tried to fly. At first, it was merely a leap, but the second time, she focused more, and she soared. She also used her Super-Speed to hurry things up and save Alex and the people on board. She used her Super-Strength to try and catch the plane and safely land it instead of it crashing down to the city. Kara was able to reach it and she tried to stop it from free-falling to the ground. Another obstacle has come up and it was already pretty much down but still in the air and it was going to crash on a bridge. Kara was able to swiftly rotate it and safely drop it on the oceans of National City. A helicopter shined a light on her, having other news outlets reveal her as National City’s guardian angel. To keep her identity a secret, she flew away from the scene and immediately back into her loft. She grabbed a blanket, sat on the couch, and was very happy hearing about her being a savior on the news. Alex was able to reach Kara’s loft and see if each other was okay. Alex became angry and disappointed at Kara for being very irrational in her decision to save that plane. They resulted in conflict and ended their discussion with Kara saying “you should go”. The next day though held new obstacles for Kara the Danvers instead of Kara the heroine.</div>
        <h3 style="color:white">Less of a Secret</h3>
        <div class="box">It is another day of work in CatCo and Cat came storming, being angry at her employees for losing the chance of a lifetime to get the first scoop on National City’s new hero. After Cat spoke to her leading workers, she asked Kara to go to layouts to get the new layouts for their magazine. When she arrived, she found a man unpacking his stuff. Kara was surprised at the sight of a framed picture of Superman. She connected all the dots and found out that this mysterious man with a framed picture of her secret cousin in his secret life was Superman’s best friend Jimmy Olsen from Metropolis. Jimmy asked Kara to simply call him James as he is trying to start a new life here in National City away from always asking for Superman’s help whenever he is scared. Kara was frozen with the charm of James and formed a little crush on him. Cat had explained some of the bad parts that this mysterious woman has done. All of this made Kara think that no one is happy for her. This led to asking her best friend Winn to meet her on the roof. Kara set herself to tell Winn the truth about what she is. At first, Winn did not believe her, but actions speak louder than words. When Kara saw that Winn did not comprehend what she tried to say, she jumped off the roof and showed him that she was flying. Winn was now part of the very small number of people that know that Kara is a Kryptonian and is the Superman’s cousin.</div>
        <h3 style="color:white">Supergirl & Her Super-Suit</h3>
        <div class="box">This amazing guardian is now out there for National City to wonder where she is. Kara wanted to go on a hero-spree and stop as much crime as she can. Winn of course was her man behind the computer and helped her by hacking into the NCPD scanner and find out if there is any sort of crime in progress. Alongside this, Winn is also testing out making new suits for Kara. At first, they had a blue crop top and shorts. Kara's first attempt in being super was for a car speeding. She was about to make a sharp turn, but when she tried, she went straight away from the side. When she came back to the loft, Winn realized that a cape is essential for turns. Kara's second attempt was in a bank robbery in which Winn wanted be assured that Kara is in fact bulletproof and she was and succeeded in stopping this, but her cape wasn't and was damaged by the time she returned. This time, Winn made the cape from a special impenetrable polymer and made the blue crop top long sleeves and covered her top until her waist except for her neck and above and kept the red skirt. Also, Winn finally added in the special S on her chest which he assumed stands for Super. Kara was quick to correct him because it was not an S. It stood for her family. The House of El. And their family motto. El mayarah. Stronger together. They picked up another crime on their scanners and Kara was away. On her way to the crime, Kara became unconscious after a weakening weapon was used against her to capture her. There is only one thing that can hurt her with a yellow sun around and that is a radioactive piece from her home world Krypton which Clark or Kal-El named Kryptonite. Kara did not even know about this dangerous substance's existence at all. When she had awoken, she was strapped down to a bed with Kryptonite emitters around the cuffs she was strapped on, enough to supress her powers, but not hurt her. She was in a secret government black ops unit facility named the Department of Extra-Normal Operations, also known as the DEO. She saw the man in charge of it all. His name was Hank Henshaw. He explained to her where she is and what is happening. She also saw her sister Alex and saw that Alex was an agent for an operation that's sole purpose is to track down and hunt beings like her, aliens. She was set free and was told more information about these certain things. In the end, Kara stormed out, mad at Alex and was absolutely not ready for the challenge to come in the morning. The next day, she saw on the news that her boss Cat Grant named the heroine, Supergirl. Kara stormed into her office and told of Cat saying that CatCo cannot name her that, saying it is anti-feminist as to it being Superwoman instead of Supergirl. Cat told her that CatCo did not name Supergirl, Cat did. She also asked rhetorically, what is the problem with the word girl. She's a girl, and Kara's boss, and the Queen of All Media, and the source of all news worthy to be heard of in National City. She asked Kara to give her one single good reason why Kara shouldn't be fired on the spot. Kara had stood frozen until a certain someone knocks on the door. That person in CatCo's new arrival, all the way from Metropolis, James Olsen. James said that Kara was keeping a secret from Cat that she was trying to perfect. He said that she got a clear shot and view of Supergirl and showed the shot to Cat as well. Cat let her go, but something else was behind James' extreme generosity. They were making their way to the elevator and before James got in, he asked Kara to meet him on the roof after he said that crime is tiresome work for Kara. Kara came up to the roof stomping up saying "YOU KNEW?!" and then "HE TOLD YOU!". Clark knew that James wanted to move and he asked James for the favour of him to move to National City. Clark wanted the hero life for Kara but he wanted her to choose it for herself. A gift from Clark was given to Kara and it was the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby on Krypton before it's doom. Kara saw this as an act of kindness, compassion, and love. She finally felt more courageous to go out there and keep National City from harm.</div>
        <h3 style="color:white">Vartox's Villainry</h3>
        <div class="box">It has been revealed why there was an engine failure for Flight 237 to Geneva. It was because an elite group of aliens, former-prisoners of a ship jail called Fort Rozz, tried to draw out the daughter of the person that sentenced them to life in that jail. Kara is the daughter of Alura Zor-El and Alura is the judge and the executioner of criminals and decides whether they deserve life sentences to Fort Rozz. Vartox was the agent that was sent to hunt down Kara Zor-El to get revenge on Alura for ruining their lives. Vartox is Valeronian criminal who has impressive skills in combat and improves them the more will he has to kill the person he is in combat with. Vartox and the people he worked for just needed the confirmation that Alura's daughter, Kara was alive and is a citizen of Earth. After that, he launched the plan to confront her and kill her as revenge towards her mother. The way he confronted Kara was while she was trying to tackle things at her job in CatCo. He amplified his voice in a frequency that only aliens can hear. He asked her to meet him at a power plant, lined with lead to make sure she doesn't see through anything. Kara arrived and she came across that problem but she also found a way to detect him, by using her Super-Hearing to hear his heartbeat. She thought that would work but he attacked from behind and from the top. They had a battle that had Kara feel physical pain for the first time since she left Krypton. In the end, the DEO arrived and Vartox fled off, leaving Kara with a very sore and open wound. She got knocked unconscious in the heat of the battle and awoke in the DEO once again, but under sun lamps to strengthen her. Because of the yellow sun radiation, her Kryptonian cells got to work again and fixed her wound immediately. Supergirl's weakness in trying to fight Vartox was the fact that she couldn't even fight. She doesn't understand the rules of combat, the techniques, the skills, and all of those things that are really effective in a battle, especially against a criminal with a lot of experience. She had already been able to make amends with Alex by this time, and they started to train. Of course, Kara had enough time to know the basics but did not have enough time to know everything. The DEO spotted Vartox and she flew there as fast as she could. They fought and fought and fought until the plan that she and Alex cooped up was ready to be placed. Vartox had a special weapon, a very advanced technological ax that get extremely heated. Supergirl must use her Heat-Vision to try and overload the ax and get it to explode, rendering Vartox powerless to stop her. She was able to succeed but was surprised that in the end, Vartox killed himself to choose death over capture. A very shocking reveal of who Vartox works for comes and is one of the most emotionally draining experiences that Kara will have to face as Kara Zor-El and as Supergirl.</div>
        <h3 style="color:white">The Army of the Escaped Prisoners from Fort Rozz</h3>
        <div class="box">A high group of criminals from Fort Rozz are now gunning for National City's newest hero Supergirl. A very emotional revelation has come to pass, as it is revealed that the leader of it all is none other than our very own Kara Zor-El's aunt Astra, who is the general, alongside her lieutenant Non, with their army of rogue Kryptonians. When they confronted Kara by kidnapping her sister Alex while she was on a job to try and pursuit a criminal from Fort Rozz. Alex was used as bait and when Kara found her, she was immediately attacked by a certain face she was all too familiar with. She saw her Aunt Astra, right before her very eyes. At first, she was in huge shock as she believed that her aunt died with her family on Krypton, but did not know that her mother sentenced Astra and Non to Fort Rozz a year before Krypton's death. Sadness, anger, confusion, and a lot of vulnerable emotions came overflowing inside Kara as she tried her best to battle out Astra and her team, so that she could free Alex and figure out a plan to defeat her new foes. The DEO eventually arrived at the scene and was able to aid Supergirl in her fight against this new challenge that they face. The Kryptonian army retreated because Hank used a Kryptonite knife that surprised Astra when it cut her, because with the Earth's yellow sun, there should be no such thing as pain or defeat with them. When the smoke cleared, they were able to bring Alex home, with a bad leg but can heal overtime, and tried to devise a plan to stop Astra and Non. But their next face-off is just for another day. </div>
        <h3 style="color:white">Supergirl's Adversaries: Part 1: Reactron</h3>
        <div class="box">During Supergirl's beginnings, she has gone through quite the lot of super villains. One of the firsts was a man named Reactron, a villain James Olsen named, and a villain that even Superman could not defeat. At first, James asked Kara if maybe she should call Clark for this because he believed that if Superman couldn't do it, how can an unexperienced beginner do it? Kara took it very harshly because she did not want to compare her winnings and losses with Superman's, and make the name Supergirl mean something, independently. Reactron broke into the Lord Facility and tried to kidnap a scientist to help him, but the CEO and founder of Lord Technologies, Max Lord, stepped in to save his worker from the dangers of Reactron. Max convinced Reactron to take him instead and they rushed on away back to Reactron's hideout. The DEO was able to track him and Supergirl fled all the way there to save Max from getting hurt by Reactron. Reactron dropped the first hit, and when Supergirl was down, she was able to see Max and immediately told him to run. After that, it was the showdown between Supergirl and Reactron. Reactron believes that Superman is the reason that the people he loves were taken away from him, so in return he wants to take away his cousin, Supergirl. She was able to weaken Reactron more than Superman ever could, but she still went down, but before she got knocked out, she saw the back of a man fighting to protect her and stop the villain that she faced well. For her, it was very easy to deduce that it was Superman. When Kara awoke, she was back on her loft, with Alex and James by her side. The TV was on and an interview with Max Lord said that he wanted to thank the amazing hero that saved him that day. He said that he wanted to thank Superman. Kara was very disheartened by that and was very confused as to why he came there in the first place when he didn't even know that they were fighting. James looked at Kara with guilt after that, and she figured out that James was the one that called him, using a watch that he gave him to signify if ever he was in any trouble. Supergirl clearly said that he wasn't the one in trouble. She asked James to get out due to her pain and anger about this. Before he left, James said "I'm sorry that I called your cousin. But I'm not sorry that you're still alive". Kara needed time to process it and when she did, James confided in her saying that the reason he left Metropolis was because of that watch. Because he pushes that button every time he gets scared. He wanted to leave because he wanted to be his own hero. They made up and Kara still knew in her heart that she was the one that defeated Reactron. In the end, Kara and Clark had a text messaging conversation about how she did something he couldn't and how blood bonds us all. How he didn't learn that from Kansas. He learned it from her.</div>
        <h3 style="color:white">Supergirl's Adversaries: Part 2: Livewire</h3>
        <div class="box">It's Thanksgiving time now in National City and Kara and Alex are expecting to see their mother from their hometown Midvale. Alex is hyperventilating, basically being a wreck worrying about what her mother will say to her after she let Kara become Supergirl. When Eliza arrived, she said that was proud of Kara and Alex for the amazing work that they both have done. Alex had felt a big relief after this and just thanked the stars for giving her a calm holiday. The radio is on and everyone in National City is listening to CatCo Plaza's resident spokesperson Leslie Willis, and her current episode of her podcast on the radio is about the things that she has hated over the past year, a special episode to commemorate Thanksgiving. Leslie said that nothing was on her list except for one thing, Supergirl. She insulted her body, weight, sexuality, planet of origin, costume, ability, and everything else that is about Supergirl, which means anything about Kara. During the day, Kara came to work and saw that Leslie was in Cat's office. Of course, Kara had the power of Super-Hearing which means that she can hear whatever they are talking about. Cat was telling Leslie off, saying that it is absolutely unacceptable for her to insult Supergirl in such a way. Cat says that since she named Supergirl, Supergirl is linked to CatCo forever. She also said that the people do not want Leslie's brand of negativity anymore, but instead they want positivity, hope, compassion, the things that make them feel like they continue to go on with their lives and put some good out to the world. She also added in saying that if she could legally adopt Supergirl, she would, which our listening-in Kara felt heart warmed by. Leslie was angry asking if Cat is actually dictating her content now, and Leslie leaving and saying that Cat is a hypocrite. Now Cat has had it and said that she is done. Leslie tried to snap back saying that she has a few years left in her contract and Cat is too cheap and has too much pride to buy her out. Cat of course agreed and instead said that Leslie will be on helicopter news. After this, Kara asked Winn what he would be doing for Thanksgiving, and hearing about his orphan Thanksgiving made Kara invite Winn to the family dinner tonight. Winn was a bit embarrassed at first but accepted Kara's invitation. Tonight was also a very special night for Alex because she had finally wanted to tell her mother about her real job as a DEO agent and not a full-time scientist in the field of bio-engineering. Alex was no longer very nervous about this until the news was on about Kara's new save. Eliza asked Alex to turn it off, in a tone saying that she is not happy about Kara being National City's new hero. They got into a heated argument and ended on a bad note. While on helicopter duty, Leslie was in the middle of a storm and wanted to stay there just to stick it to Cat. Lightning hit their helicopter and killed the pilot but not Leslie, although still made them come crashing down. Luckily for Leslie and her pilot, Supergirl came to the scene and was able to stop her from getting hurt. Supergirl took Leslie's hand to try and save her but Supergirl got hit with lightning whilst being hand in hand with Leslie. Leslie got electrocuted as well and ended up in a coma in the hospital. Cat paid for her room and her medical bills here, but tried to play off to Kara that she does not care at all about Leslie. Cat asked Kara to leave the room and ready them a car back to CatCo Plaza. Cat then said this to Leslie on her hospital bed, "Get over yourself, Willis. You and I both know you're stronger than this. Come on!". Right after that, Leslie opened her eyes and felt a surge going through her body. She teleported out of the hospital by transforming herself into energy and going through technology until she lands on the ground transforming back into her human body. After this, she came to an alley and didn't realize what to do now. A thug tried to hurt her but she ended up electrifying him. She was quick to learn how to use her newfound powers to her advantage. Meanwhile, it's dinner night at Kara's loft and as usual, Eliza tries to correct Alex in saying that she has been drinking a lot of alcohol. Alex ignored her mother and continued to drink. Kara thought that it would be nice to go around the table and have everyone say what they are thankful for. Kara and Winn tried to keep things down, but another argument between Alex and Eliza sparked up and ended up with Alex finally telling her mother what she truly does for a living. Eliza was very disappointed, while Alex was very surprised because now she has dedicated her life into protecting Kara, her job was to ensure that, literally now and yet Eliza was still very disappointed in her. Alex stormed out of the loft saying that she can never win with Eliza. Winn headed out too after that and thanked Kara for the lovely night. The power mysteriously went out, but shortly after that, Kara received a text message from Cat saying that she must come to CatCo immediately. When she arrived, everything was not working, it was dark, and Cat was on a rampage saying that she wants to find out what is happening. The screens lighted up and she and Kara saw Leslie in it, talking to them, with white hair and a new costume, with a new name saying that she is now Livewire. She came out of the monitors and attacked Cat and Kara. Cat told Kara to go get help from security and after she left, Supergirl came to help Cat. Thanks to Supergirl, Livewire was weakened, she retreated, and Cat was safe. The DEO came there to investigate, posing as FBI agents with special shapeshifting ID cards. The DEO was able to give Kara the closure on how Leslie became Livewire. She was struck by lightning, but not directly. Supergirl was blasted, holding Leslie by her hand. Leslie got struck by lightning that mixed with Kryptonian DNA which gave her superpowers, meaning that Supergirl is Element X. When they left, Kara and Cat are still left with a powered out media headquarters with no way to reach the public. Cat told Kara to fetch Supergirl and when Supergirl came back, she and Cat decided to work together to bring Livewire down. Cat was able to send a message asking Livewire to meet with her at "the place where it all began". Cat tried to talk some sense into Livewire but Livewire only had one goal, to kill Cat and get revenge for everything that has happened to her. Supergirl flew in and got into a battle with Livewire. Supergirl was brought down, and while Livewire had Cat by the throat, Supergirl was able to hear that there was water below the ground. Water interferes with electricity badly so she grabbed the pipe from underground and hosed Livewire completely, defeating her. Alex came back to the loft to see how Eliza was and at the very first talk, Alex said that she had no power left in her like the city to fight anymore. They had a conversation about why Eliza was so hard on Alex, how Alex struggled so much with everything that had happened because she had to keep this from her own mom. They eventually came to an understanding. Eliza said that there was something urgent that she needed to tell Alex and Kara immediately, but Alex had to pull away because the DEO needed her. When Kara and Alex were sending off Eliza, she said the urgent news that the girls needed to know. She said that she had known about the DEO for a long time. She had known because Jeremiah used to work there until he died. Not in a plane crash, like they said, because Eliza never believed that. She said that their father died working for a man named Hank Henshaw. A weird thing had currently happened in the DEO with Hank. His eyes glowed red as though he was an alien. What mysteries could be unfolded after this?</div>
