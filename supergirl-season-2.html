        <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 2: Episode 1: "The Adventures of Supergirl"</h1>
        <div class="box">A pod careens through National City. Supergirl and Martian Manhunter pursue. The pod knocks a worker off of a building which J'onn handles. They both land at the pod's crash site to find that the pod is identical to Kara's pod and there is a comatose alien inside.

          Afterwards, J'onn flies Kara to a new D.E.O. headquarters, a skyscraper, to which Kara wonders why J'onn had her fly to the cave headquarters every day. They place the comatose man in the infirmary and believe he is from Krypton due to the pod and the fact that syringe needles were unable to penetrate his skin. J'onn tasks Winn with gathering more information on the pod. Alex asks Kara about her and James Olsen's impending date and notices Kara acting overeager to mask her true feelings. At CatCo, Cat Grant asks Kara about which job she has decided on. Kara says an online quiz claimed that marketing was her ideal career path, but Cat thought that was pathetic. Cat prods Kara to look inward to find out her purpose. Cat then summons her new assistant, Eve Teschmacher, and chastises her improper salad preparation. Cat told Kara she wasn't thrilled by Kara's choice of her replacement.

          James arrives to Kara's apartment and brings her favorites, pizza and potstickers. James asks her about the Venture launch, knowing that Kara is interested and tells her that he's okay with her watching it on TV. They watch the broadcast and see that the Venture is crashing. Meanwhile, Clark Kent is on the phone with Perry White when he sees the Venture malfunction on the news. Kara and Clark race off to save the space shuttle. Supergirl steadies the ship as Superman super-breathes to extinguish the fire. As they land and save the ship, they greet a group of bicyclists.
          
          They arrive back at the D.E.O. building. The various D.E.O. staffers stop what they're doing and look in awe when Superman arrives. Superman shakes hands and Kara introduces him to a nervous Winn. He offers his assistance to Alex in the search for her father and coldly greets J'onn. They all go to the comatose alien's room. Winn figures out that the pod traveled through the Well of Stars where time doesn't pass, explaining the alien's lack of aging. J'onn then tells them that the Venture suffered an explosion while rocketing to space and that they should investigate. Kara and Clark leave, so Alex asks J'onn what happened between him and Clark, but J'onn walks away.
          
          Kara takes Clark to CatCo where Clark and James reunite. Clark then meets Cat Grant, who gushes over him. Cat takes him on a tour of CatCo. Kara apologizes to James about their date being cut short and promises to make it up to him. After getting a call from Alex, Kara tells Clark that Lena Luthor was booked on the Venture but didn't show up to the flight.
          
          Meanwhile, John Corben is meeting with a dealer about a weaponized drone. He kills the dealer with the drone and calls someone on the phone saying that due to Superman and Supergirl's rescue of the Venture, he's changing plans. Kara and Clark question Lena Luthor about any involvement with the shuttle disaster. Both Kryptonian cousins discreetly x-ray the room, while Lena was looking away, but didn't find anything suspicious. Lena tells them that she wasn't on the shuttle because of her plans to rename her company from Luther Corp to L-Corp and change her company for the better, since she intends to redeem the Luthor name, and also to make a name for herself this way altogether. Clark is skeptical of Lena due to his past involvement with her brother but Kara believes her. Clark then asks Kara about her relationship with James. Kara tells him how she is struggling to balance her life as Kara and as Supergirl but Clark assures her that she will know if James and her are meant to be together.

          At the D.E.O., Alex confronted J'onn about Operation: Emerald. J'onn told her that he and Superman investigated a meteorite that contained what J'onn named kryptonite. Superman wanted to destroy the kryptonite but J'onn decided to keep it to fight back against other Kryptonians.
          
          Winn's investigation found that the part that caused the Venture to explode was housed under the same seat Lena Luthor was supposed to sit in, indicating that Lena was the target.
          
          Lena boarded a helicopter. While en route, Corben's attack drones open fire on her helicopter. Supergirl and Superman arrived and shielded the helicopter from the bullets. Corben tells them he has additional drones targeting civilians throughout the city. Clark rescues the civilians while Kara protects the chopper and rescues Lena.
          
          Later, Kara meets up with James. James tells her that he has noticed a change in Kara and she tells him she doesn't know if their relationship is what she wants anymore. Kara talks to Cat who tells her that something is wrong with her because she is afraid of change and encourages Kara to be daring.
          
          Winn analyzes a drone and links it to international assassin John Corben. After the briefing, Alex prods J'onn to talk to Clark who adamantly tells him that as long as J'onn keeps kryptonite at the D.E.O., he is unwilling to be a part of their operation.
          
          Lena pushes forward with the renaming ceremony despite Kara encouraging her to cancel it. During her speech, explosions go off. Kara saves James and a lady from falling rubble. Alex pursues Corben who nearly shoots Lena. The Luthor Corp/L-Corp building begins to fall due to the bombs. Clark holds the building while Kara repairs the damaged structure. Alex fights Corben hand to hand but Corben gets the upper-hand and holds Alex at gunpoint in front of Kara. From behind, Lena shoots Corben who is taken to a hospital.
          
          After the attack, Lena thanks Clark for the positive story he published about L-Corp. Clark apologizes to Lena about his initial opinions of her. Lena wishes them well and tells Kara that she hopes it's not the last time they see each other.
          
          At CatCo, Kara tells Cat that she has decided that she wants to work for CatCo as a reporter in order to tell stories that will improve the world and push her out of her comfort zone. Cat shows Kara her résumé with reporter written on it, which Cat had written the day Kara first interviewed for her assistant job. Cat tells her she sees the hero within Kara and wants Kara to make her proud. Kara talks to James admitting that something has changed and tells him that they should stay as friends. J'onn makes Winn a D.E.O. agent. Clark tells Kara that he's going to stay in town for a little bit hoping to have Kara tell him stories about Krypton and his parents. Alex then alerts them of a robbery so the two of them fly away.

          An unknown woman has Corben moved from the hospital. She looks over Corben and offers him a place in Project Cadmus which John accepts. The woman then presses a button causing Corben's body to change, proclaiming "Long live Metallo".</div>

          <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 2: Episode 2: "The Last Children of Krypton"</h1>
          <div class="box">Supergirl and Superman arrive at a burning building. Supergirl uses her super-breath to quell the fire as Superman flies fast enough to create a rain cloud over the building. The firefighters look on in awe. The two of them then respond to a robbery, stopping the thieves' car. The thieves fire bullets at the Kryptonian heroes but they have no effect and are easily knocked out. J'onn then directs them to a Kigori in Riverside Park. At headquarters, Alex and Winn notice J'onn's grim demeanor with having to deal with Superman in town.

            A woman wakes up John Corben from his operation. Corben realizes that he has enhanced strength. The woman explains that she is a doctor working for Cadmus who offers him to save the world from aliens.
            
            At the D.E.O., J'onn chastises Kara for having too much fun with Clark and not following protocol. A power surge hits the building. Winn says the source is the holding area with the comatose alien. They figure out that the alien is using electrical energy to repair himself at a cellular level. After J'onn and Clark get into another spat, Kara tells J'onn to get along with Clark while he is in town. Alex reminds Kara of their sister night. Kara tells Alex she invited Clark. Kara reports to CatCo for her first day on the job as a reporter. Cat Grant introduces Kara to her new boss, Snapper Carr, who runs CatCo Magazine's investigation team and who doesn't seem too interested in his new stringer.

            At Kara's apartment, Clark tells Kara he will be heading back to Metropolis. They see a bridge jumper on the news and leave for the bridge. They arrive and discover it's actually Corben, now introducing himself as Metallo, who hits Clark with a beam from the kryptonite core in his chest. Supergirl punches him to no effect. Metallo holds Superman in a choke hold. Supergirl fires her heat-vision but Metallo blocks it with his cybernetic hand. Supergirl takes cover behind a car as Metallo fires kryptonite beams at her. Supergirl jumps on top of the car but is struck by Metallo's beam. Superman then hits Metallo sending him flying away in the distance. Superman carries Supergirl in his arms and flies her back to the D.E.O. Clark confronts J'onn about the kryptonite, who admits that a D.E.O. shipment of kryptonite went missing months ago and that there may be a mole within the agency touching off a heated argument between the two. Suddenly, all of National City's computers and televisions are hacked and a broadcast from Cadmus declares war on all aliens.
            
            In Snapper's office, Snapper tells off Kara for missing the editorial meeting and that she hasn't earned a place in his office. Snapper tells Kara to get out of his office. Kara goes to Cat to get her help, but Cat tells her that Kara needs to deal with him on her own. Cat then tells her that she taking a leave of absence from CatCo which Kara doesn't take too well.
            
            The woman from Cadmus tells her associates that the incident on the bridge wasn't a total failure and that she plans on proceeding to Phase Two. She instructs her lackeys to restrain Dr. Gilcrist and take him away for modification.
            
            At the Fortress of Solitude, Clark and J'onn resume their debate. J'onn reveals that he speaks Kryptonian and tells Clark that both of them have no homes and the importance of preserving each other's histories. Clark says he doesn't hate J'onn, just that he can't trust him so long as he keeps kryptonite. Clark has Kelex scan his hand for residual materials from his fight with Metallo. Kelex discovers residual promethium.
            
            Kara tells Alex that she wants to move to Metropolis to be with Clark. Alex confesses that she has stayed silent since Clark has been in town and confesses that she needs Kara so that they can protect each other. Alex tells her that protecting her all these years has cost her a lot.
            
            At the D.E.O., J'onn has Winn trace the promethium and finds Metallo in the industrial district. Superman and Supergirl knock down Metallo but Metallo tells them that another man is terrorizing Metropolis. They fly to Metropolis to see Gilcrist's trail of destruction. Winn and Alex are working on the anti-kryptonite suits. Winn tells Alex of his experience of living in foster homes and says that being family is not about keeping score, but simply showing up. Winn and Alex then come up with a plan to use a geiger counter to determine which D.E.O. agent stole the kryptonite. In the locker room, they identify agent J. McGill as the mole. Alex tasks McGill with readying a transport of kryptonite for transfer. Kara later walks into the D.E.O. and forces Winn to tell her where Alex went.

            Alex catches McGill with the kryptonite and points her gun at him. Before Alex can arrest him, the woman from Cadmus appears from behind and shoots him. Alex questions the woman about her father's whereabouts. The woman tries to convince her to join Cadmus and to imagine her life if aliens hadn't come to Earth, but Alex declines. The woman gestures to her guards and leaves. Alex knocks over the guards and runs from their gunfire. Alex pins one of them down but the other points his gun at her. Supergirl crashes down from the ceiling and catches the bullet. They both knock out the guards and Kara apologizes to Alex for making her fell like she was prioritizing Clark over her.
            
            At the D.E.O., Winn shows them the completed anti-Kryptonite suits. Kara comes up with a plan to stop both Metallos. Superman engages Gilcrist/Metallo in Metropolis and Kara engages Corben/Metallo in National City. The anti-kryptonite suits withstand both Metallos' chest beams. Supergirl and Superman fight the Metallos in their respective cities. A well placed punch by both Metallos disable the anti-kryptonite suits weakening the Kryptonians. Martian Manhunter then comes to Superman's aid and helps Superman dispatch Gilcrist by punching out his kryptonite heart. Alex comes to Supergirl's aid and uses a mech-suit to go toe-to-toe with Corben, stabbing Corben in his kryptonite heart. Supergirl then pays a visit to Cat before she leaves. Cat is excited to leave but Supergirl tells her to come back eventually, which Cat promises to. Supergirl then leaves to the CatCo office and speed-changes into regular clothes. James tells Kara that he is taking Cat's position while she is away and offers to talk to Snapper for Kara but Kara insists on dealing with him on her own. Kara turns in her article on the Metallo attacks to Snapper. Snapper doesn't think much of the article but he tells her to return tomorrow.

            At the D.E.O., J'onn turns over all of the department's kryptonite to Superman. Clark says goodbye to Alex, Winn, and Kara. Superman then leaves with the kryptonite and heads to Metropolis. Clark receives an angry call from Perry White for his absence.
            
            Kara sits by the comatose alien's bedside. The alien suddenly wakes up and clutches Kara by the neck.</div>
            <hr>
            <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 2: Episode 3: "Welcome to Earth"</h1>
            <div class="box">The comatose alien awakened and grabbed Kara's neck. He throws her to the side and walks out into the main area. He attacks some D.E.O. guards and jumps out a window leaping to the ground below, unharmed. Later, J'onn informs Kara and Alex that President Olivia Marsdin is visiting National City to sign the Alien Amnesty Act. Kara is excited for the new law but J'onn disagrees with it due to his past experiences. Alex informs Kara that Supergirl is expected to greet the President on the tarmac.

              James holds his first editorial meeting as interim head of CatCo. During the meeting, Snapper Carr undermines James's agenda and takes control of the meeting. James tries to assign Kara to interview the President but Snapper reassigns her to interview Lena Luthor instead.
              
              Supergirl arrives on the tarmac to meet the President. Suddenly, fiery blasts attack secret service agents and nearly kill the President before Kara shields her with her cape. Later, Alex tells Kara that the President has been re-located to the D.E.O. headquarters. Kara remarks to Alex how nice the President was. They believe the escaped "Kryptonian" was behind the attacks. Alex then spots some NCPD officers investigating the crime scene. Alex meets the lead detective, Maggie Sawyer, and masquerades as a Secret Service agent to tell her that the crime scene wasn't within NCPD jurisdiction so Maggie leaves. The President thanks J'onn for the work that the D.E.O. has been doing but tells him that the Alien Amnesty Act will change their focus. J'onn disagrees with the President's rationale for the Act but she insists that it's important to hope that extending a hand in friendship is the best path forward.

              Kara arrives in Lena's office and asks her about her stance on the amnesty bill. Lena shows Kara a device she invented that can identify aliens. Kara tells Lena that she believes this kind of device will force aliens back into hiding. Lena justifies it by saying that humans have a right to know who amongst them is actually human and points out the lucrative profit that the device will make for L-Corp. Kara discreetly uses heat-vision on the device while Lena isn't looking. Lena them urges Kara to use the alien detection device; the results come back negative.
              
              Winn tracks the renegade "Kryptonian" to an Arts District warehouse. A D.E.O. strike team finds Maggie Sawyer already there causing Maggie to realize that Alex is actually a D.E.O. agent. Alex informs Winn that the fugitive isn't there.
              
              At an observatory, the fugitive alien grabs a human by the throat demanding to go home.
              
              Kara chides Alex for going after the alien alone. Alex then receives a call from Maggie inviting her to see how local police gather intel on aliens.
              
              Snapper criticizes Kara's scoop on Lena Luthor as biased and tells her to rewrite her article without her personal beliefs in it. Kara and James both vent to each other about their frustrations with Snapper. Kara tells James that Cat Grant must have put him in charge for a reason so he should be the boss he wants to be. Alex meets Maggie at an underground alien bar. Alex notices that many of the patrons are aliens and readies her gun but Maggie calms her down and tells her the bar is a safe space for non-humans. Darla serves them drinks. Maggie remarks that Darla is her ex-girlfriend and that she can relate to aliens because she also felt alone as a non-white and non-straight girl in Nebraska. Another bar patron walks up to them asking about Alex. Alex asks him if he has seen the alien they are after. The patron tells them that the fugitive was trying to contact his home planet but didn't know where exactly he was.

              Alex tells Winn to scan for orbital transmissions into deep space. Winn tracks a signal to the Mt. Pride Observatory and says the alien beamed a signal to a planet called Daxam. Supergirl crashes into the observatory and attacks the alien but is knocked over by him. Kara and him fight but Kara defeats him and takes him to the D.E.O. Kara explains to the others that Krypton and Daxam had a long feud with each other due to philosophical and political differences.
              
              Kara questions the Daxamite about his alleged attack on the President but he doesn't say anything. As Kara turns away, he asks if they have Zakkarian ale on Earth. After a brief argument between them about the merits of their own species over the other's, Kara asks him about his signal to Daxam. He says it's a distress signal, but Kara doesn't believe him or his claim that he has nothing to do with the attack on the President.
              
              Kara meets again with Lena who wanted to thank Kara for her article in CatCo Magazine. Kara admits that her original article was a scathing review of her new device but that her boss ordered her to rewrite it. Kara told Lena that she has begun to see things from her point of view, even though she still supports amnesty. Lena tells Kara of how she used to adore Lex as a child and that she tried to bring him back to the good side but realized that some people are just bad. At the president's ceremony, the President gives a speech to a crowd about the Amnesty Act and begins to sign the bill. Suddenly, she is attacked again by an Infernian, Scorcher, who takes out multiple secret service agents, Kara, and Alex. Maggie attempts to apprehend her, but Scorcher grabs her gun. Kara spins around to get rid of the flames on her. However, Scorcher and Maggie are missing.

              Alex goes to the bar and interrogates Worris about Scorcher, but the bartender tells her that Scorcher hangs out by the foundry.
              
              Scorcher ties up Maggie and tells her that she is pathetic for fighting for aliens and tells her that she believes amnesty is just a form of registration. Supergirl arrives and blasts Scorcher with heat vision, which Scorcher reciprocates. She then blasts Maggie and Alex and does battle with Supergirl. Supergirl uses her cold breath to encase Scorcher in ice. Scorcher melts the ice and they fight again. Supergirl flies in circles around Scorcher to create a vacuum, negating her fire powers. Maggie grabs a gun and arrests the Infernian.
              
              At CatCo, James informs Snapper that he rewrote one of his articles. Snapper gets angry, but James reiterates that he is his boss and has control of all editorial content. James offers a truce to stay out of Snapper's way if Snapper respects James. Kara congratulates James for the effort. Alex brings Maggie to the D.E.O. for medical attention. Maggie thanks Alex for saving her life while Alex thanks Maggie for getting her to see that not all aliens are bad. Maggie leaves to go meet another lady for a date. Kara revisits the Daxamite's cell and apologizes to him for her prejudices and accusations against him. She introduces herself to him as Kara Zor-El, a fellow refugee on Earth. He introduces himself as Mon-El and asks if she will help him contact Daxam. Kara informs Mon-El of the fate of their worlds, and that Daxam was now a wasteland. The President thanks J'onn and Kara for their protection. She mentions to Kara about another jet she owns and walks away, briefly morphing into a different form.

              J'onn later visits Al's Dive Bar in his Martian form and sits down for a drink, which seems to startle the bartender. J'onn runs after her and discovers that she is M'gann M'orzz, a fellow Martian.</div>

              <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 2: Episode 4: "Survivors"</h1>
              <div class="box">In Mon-El's flashback, the remains of the destroyed Krypton rain down onto Daxam. During the chaos, Mon-El escorts the prince to a Kryptonian ship. When Mon-El enters the pod to start up the engine, the prince closes the hatch and willingly stays behind, allowing Mon-El to escape.

                After Mon-El finishes telling the team of his job as the palace guard and his recollection of how he got to Earth, he is confined to the D.E.O. headquarters. J'onn leaves to attend to personal manners.
                
                Maggie contacts Alex about a dead Syvillian. Alex and Supergirl arrive but after Supergirl isn't any help to them, Alex and Maggie leave to gather more information.
                
                At CatCo, Kara relays the alien murder story to Snapper. Snapper then peppers her with questions which Kara doesn't have answers to. He tells her it's just a half-baked idea and tells her to go get more on the scoop.
                
                At Al's Dive Bar, J'onn meets up with M'gann asking her about how she escaped the genocide. She told him that a White Martian broke rank and rescued Green Martians, smuggling her off-world to Earth.
                
                Winn tells Alex about her alien perp, a Brevakk, and prepares to organize a strike team. Alex turns it down and calls Maggie instead. They question the Brevakk, but he fights back. They pin him down to arrest him, but armed men show up, taze them, and kidnap the alien.
                
                At the D.E.O., J'onn prepares to go after the armed men. Alex and Kara notice the extra grumpiness. J'onn tells them of M'gann and how she didn't seem to want to psychically bond with him as Green Martians usually do. They tell J'onn to apologize and let M'gann know how he feels. Kara talks to her A.I. "mother" about her first published article. Mon-El accidentally barges in and asks about the hologram. After Alura starts to talk bad about Daxamites, Kara shuts the program off. She tells him that the hologram helps her feel less alone. Mon-El proposes that Kara could accompany him outside the D.E.O. instead of confinement but Kara refuses and leaves.
                
                Alex meets Maggie at an illegal alien fighting ring attended by National City's elites. A woman introduces the attendees to the fighters, Quill the Brevakk and M'gann M'orzz (aka Miss Martian). The fighters battle, but M'gann uses her Martian powers to subdue Quill. Supergirl arrives and the organizer pits her against Draaga. As the fight turns against Supergirl, Alex and Maggie fire shots into the air to disperse the crowd and rescue Supergirl.
                
                At the D.E.O. infirmary, they tell J'onn of M'gann's participation in the fight club. Meanwhile, Mon-El convinces Winn to take him into the city by letting Winn design him a superhero costume and name.
                
                Kara returns to CatCo and tells Snapper of the murder's connection to an alien fighting ring. Snapper asks about her sources and prompts her to not to come until she brought him a source.
                
                Winn and Mon-El go partying at a bar. After a while, Winn gets wasted. Mon-El accidentally breaks someone's arm in an arm wrestling match so they leave.
                
                J'onn confronts M'gann about her participation in the fights. M'gann defends herself saying she does it for survival, not for the money and that she has never killed anyone in the ring. J'onn retorts by saying that as the last of their kind, they should be preserving the memories of their people but she claims that she would rather forget. As J'onn leaves, she gives him the name of the ringleader, Roulette known by the real name Veronica Sinclair.
                
                Supergirl attacks Sinclair's limo. Sinclair claims that aliens aren't people so they don't have any rights. She believes she is doing them a favor by giving them an opportunity to earn glory and money. Sinclair tells Supergirl that she is naive for thinking that anyone cares what happens to aliens.
                
                The next day, Kara tells them of the encounter with Sinclair and J'onn tells them that he knows of Winn and Mon-El's escapade last night. J'onn also tells them of his encounter with M'gann and stresses that he has worked so hard to make humans trust aliens and that it can take one to undo that work. Kara tells Mon-El about how it will take time from him to adjust to his new powers and living in the world. They talk about their parents and how both of theirs were flawed people. As Kara walks out, Mon-El mentions having seen Draaga before on Warworld and that Draaga had an injury to the right leg.
                
                J'onn apologizes to M'gann outside Al's Dive Bar. Roulette and her goons arrive on scene, subdue J'onn, and kidnap him. At the D.E.O., they work on finding J'onn. Kara goes to Lena Luthor for help. Lena reveals that she knows Roulette from boarding school and gives Kara the location of the next fight.
                
                At the fight, Roulette introduces the two Martians to the crowd and forces them to fight to the death. They fight and transform into Green Martian forms. M'gann manages to pin J'onn down and tells him she will do anything to survive but J'onn convinces her that she fights because she is guilty for surviving. M'gann tells Roulette that she refuses to kill J'onn. Roulette releases Draaga to fight the Martians. Alex, Maggie, and the police arrive and arrest crowdgoers. Supergirl also arrives and is able to defeat Draaga with a well-placed kick to Draaga's right leg. Supergirl and the police go to arrest Sinclair, but she is surrounded by her alien followers. Sinclair claims that they protect her because she provides for them. Supergirl convinces the other aliens that fighting against each other distracts from fighting against people like Cadmus and Roulette who think aliens are a menace. Roulette turns to escape, but her alien followers turn on her. Maggie arrests her. Later, Maggie is forced to release Roulette due to orders from higher-ups. Alex tells Maggie she is a great cop and asks Maggie for a drink, but Maggie has plans with a date.
                
                Kara shows Snapper her full article, complete with police reports and a first person account from Supergirl.
                
                Later, Kara tells Mon-El that she had the D.E.O. release him into her custody rather than for him to remain confined. Kara agrees to help him train to be a hero to make up for her lost opportunity to raise her cousin.
                
                J'onn meets M'gann at her her apartment. M'gann apologizes for her actions. J'onn tells her that he will always be around if she needs him. After J'onn leaves, M'gann shapeshifts, revealing herself to be a White Martian.</div>

                <div class="box">Kara helps Mon-El prepare for his first day of work by cooking him breakfast, having him try on outfits, and giving him a new Earth identity as Mike Matthews. Kara brings "Mike" to CatCo and introduces him to Eve Teschmacher and James Olsen. Kara stresses to Mon-El the importance of not using his powers and trying to be inconspicuous.

                  Alex and Maggie are hanging out at Al's Dive Bar. Maggie tells her she broke up with her last girlfriend. Alex tries to reassure her about it but Maggie decides to go home.
                  
                  While walking on the street, Kara thanks James for hiring Mon-El when suddenly a car of robbers pulls up. Kara changes into Supergirl but one of the robbers uses a laser gun to knock her back. James also fights one of the robbers, but gets beaten in the process. The laser-wielding robber fires multiple shots at Supergirl and she is unable to defeat them. In the chaos, James drops his dad's old camera.
                  
                  At the D.E.O., they identify the laser weapon as an Anndrannian Photon Cannon and work on tracking the alien weapons. Then, another city-wide broadcast hacks the D.E.O. monitors with a message from Cadmus decrying the alien amnesty and branding aliens as dangerous. Kara hypothesizes that Cadmus may be the ones dealing alien weaponry to criminals.
                  
                  At a CatCo meeting, Kara and another reporter debate whether humans need alien guns to defend themselves and disagree on the best course of action. James ends the meeting and laments the fact that he can't do more to help. They notice Eve with a mountain of paperwork. She tells them that she was helping Mike out since it is his first day. Kara goes to Mon-El and tells him off for not doing the work that he was supposed to be doing. Lena unexpectedly visits CatCo and invites Kara to a charity gala. Mon-El invites himself to the gala as well.
                  
                  At the D.E.O., Alex talks to Winn about how Maggie has been feeling down since she had broken up with her girlfriend. Winn then gets an alert about another attack. Alex alerts Kara about the attack.
                  
                  Supergirl arrives on scene finding the gang armed with alien weapons. One of the thugs launches a police car into the sky with an anti-gravity gun, so she flies off and saves the policeman inside the car. The Cadmus leader meets with Chet Miner, the leader of the gang, and warns him not to go against Supergirl. After he brushes off her comments and asks for something bigger, the woman gives him a new weapon.

                  Alex meets Maggie at the crime scene of the last attack. Alex invites Maggie to go do something to help her feel better but Maggie doesn't feel up to it. Alex suggests they go out to have some fun but Maggie thought Alex was asking her out. Alex assures Maggie that she isn't into girls but Maggie says she's heard that before from other lesbians in the past. Alex nervously leaves.
                  
                  James tells Kara that the attacks are causing people to support a repeal of the Alien Amnesty Act. Kara asks him where Mike is. She then uses her super-hearing and overhears Eve and "Mike" about to get intimate. She catches them in a supply room making out and tells Eve to go. Kara berates Mon-El for not doing more to fit in. Mon-El tells her that he doesn't want to do what she does so Kara tells him to find another mentor if he doesn't like it at CatCo.
                  
                  James meets up with Winn at the D.E.O. and asks him about the recent attacks. He gets Winn to inadvertently tell him about a possible lead at the Federal Reserve and leaves. Later that night, James dresses up in a hoodie and mask and uses a baseball bat to fight off the criminals robbing the Fed. Miner uses his new weapon to bring down a building. James races in to save the residents before the building comes crumbling down.
                  
                  As James is dressing his injuries, Winn confronts him about his fight at the Fed last night. James tells him that he is tired of being a sidekick and seeing his friends fight of criminals while he is stuck behind a camera. James asks Winn to join him on his new cause and design him a new suit. Winn declines but James tells him he will be fighting crime with or without him. Winn tells him to rethink what he's going to do and leaves.
                  
                  At her apartment, Kara vents to Alex about Mon-El's inability to take his job seriously. Alex tells Kara that she is trying too hard to make Mon-El be like Kara and needs to find out what works for him. Kara then apologizes to Alex for venting non-stop and asks what she came to talk about, but Lena unexpectedly drops by again asking Kara to get her in touch with Supergirl.
                  
                  Later that night, Miner summons the Cadmus leader and asks her for more weapons to attack Lena Luthor's fundraiser. The woman cautions him against going after the Luthors but Miner pulls a gun on her. Unfazed, the woman talks about her larger goal of ending alien presence on Earth to better the lives of her son and daughter. She tells him that she isn't afraid of him and to go after Lena at his own peril.
                  
                  Supergirl meets Lena at her L-Corp office. Lena invites Supergirl to the gala but Supergirl tells her that the risk of attack by Miner's gang is too great. Lena tells her that, like Supergirl, she is willing to take risks to see justice done. Supergirl accepts the invite, despite the expectation that both Kara and Supergirl are expected to attend.
                  
                  Kara and Winn arrive at the gala. Kara meets up with Lena, but Winn fakes spilling something on Lena's dress to distract her. Supergirl arrives to the party and tells Lena that she will be scanning the perimeter for any trouble. As she flies away, Kara returns. James arrives; Winn asks if he's here to stop crime but James tells him he's just here as a member of the community. Mon-El bumps into Kara telling her he used Eve's credit card to buy a new suit. Kara stops herself from yelling at him and they have a dance. An explosion goes off and Miner's crew arrives to the party demanding everyone turn in their wallets and jewelry, prompting Kara to run out.
                  
                  Supergirl shows up and battles the gang. She's knocked back by a blow from the laser gun. Mon-El attempts to help but is also hit with the laser gun. As Supergirl rains down heat vision blasts on the gang, Winn and Lena duck under the stage and set up a Black Body Field Generator to stop the weapons. James starts fighting the gang but is nearly hit by one of the weapons until Kara takes the hit for him. Three of the thugs then fire their weapons at her. Lena and Winn activate the generator which successfully destroys the alien guns.
                  
                  The next day, Maggie is escorting Miner into police custody when the Cadmus woman's voice appears in Miner's head. Miner and his crew suddenly collapse on the street as the woman can be seen driving by with a device in her hand.
                  
                  Winn visits James at CatCo and agrees to help him by making him a new suit. James tells him that he has already thought of a superhero name for himself. Later, Kara tells Mon-El that he is his own man and that he will need to find out for himself what kind of job he wants. As a nice gesture, Kara gives him a guide map to National City.

                  Alex meets up with Maggie at Al's Dive Bar and tells her that all of her life, she hasn't been able to be comfortable with dating. Alex tells Maggie that there was some truth to what she told her earlier.
                  
                  Supergirl meets up with Lena and thanks her for her heroism. The Cadmus woman (unbeknownst to Supergirl) walks into Lena's office, so Supergirl leaves. The woman is revealed to be Lena's mother.</div>

                  <div class="box">In Norway, a scientist alerts Dr. Rudy Jones of a frozen wolf from 3,000 BC that is still at a normal warm body temperature. Jones dissects the wolf and is attacked by something inside the wolf corpse.

                    At the alien bar, M'gann serves Mon-El and Kara some Aldebaran rum from Giggles sitting across the bar. M'gann remarks to J'onn that his friends are nice. J'onn says they help him feel less lonely. M'gann says the bar does that for her as well. Kara prods Mon-El about what job he has picked but Mon-El hasn't picked one yet. She insists on letting her train him. They both then get wasted off the rum. Alex enters the bar and catches her sister drunk. Alex spots Maggie and asks her what do about her coming out. Maggie suggests that she come out to her family. Alex thinks it might be a phase but Maggie tells her that it is real. Alex suddenly gets an alert so they all leave.
                    
                    At the D.E.O., Winn shows them a distress call from Norway's Thorul Arctic Research Station showing scientists being attacked by an unseen creature. Alex and J'onn take a jet up to the station. They find a trail of dead bodies but find Rudy Jones, a lone survivor. They take him back to headquarters. He tells them that he must continue his research into global warming and that they can find him at National City University. As he is leaving, a parasite crawls out of his mouth and through his ear.
                    
                    Mon-El trains with Kara. Kara easily avoids his punches and takes him down. After they take a break, Kara stresses the need to learn how to use his powers to make a difference. Alex pops in and asks Kara if they can talk.
                    
                    During their walk, Alex nervously opens up about her feelings for Maggie and admits to Kara that she might be gay. Alex explains how she's been constantly thinking about this and remembers how she might have felt these feelings before when she was younger, believing she's repressed feelings for other girls in the past. Kara asks if she's seeing Maggie, but Alex leaves, flustered.
                    
                    At Dr. Jones's office, he analyzes his blood and determines that he and the creature have become one. Jones's boss walks in and fires him for his beliefs about global warming. Jones reacts violently and kills his boss, sapping the life out of him.
                    
                    Winn discovers video feed of the attack at Thorul and discovers that Jones was infected and caused the deaths of the other scientists. Supergirl and Alex arrive at Jones's office and find the corpse of his boss. Jones claims they can't stop him and his cause of saving the world. Jones grabs Supergirl and starts absorbing her powers. Supergirl collapses and Alex fires shots into Rudy which have no effect. Rudy breaks down a glass window and leaves.
                    
                    Winn identifies the parasite and how it feeds on its hosts. James comes into the infirmary and checks in on Kara. James tells him he wants to help, but Kara brushes him off. Winn takes James aside. James demands his suit since Kara nearly died. Winn bluntly tells him that he will know when the suit is ready and that if he were to go out in the field, he would die. James accepts this.
                    
                    Alex arrives at her sister's apartment and tells Kara she feels like she's disappointed her. Kara insists that she is okay with Alex's coming out and invites her to sit and talk. Kara apologizes for not making it comfortable for Alex to share this with her. She sympathizes with her sister in feeling alone and shutting off a part of herself. Kara reassures Alex that she doesn't have to face it alone and encourages Alex to talk about why she likes Maggie. Afterwards, they get an alert about an alien attack downtown.
                    
                    Supergirl discovers that Mon-El is roughing up an alien, Brian, for an unpaid debt. After letting him go, Kara berates Mon-El for abusing his powers for money, saying that it goes against what being a hero stands for. Mon-El accuses Kara of being a hypocrite, claiming that Kara is fighting crime for the attention.
                    
                    After Kara reports back to the D.E.O., Winn identifies Jones's next target to be Rand O'Reilly, another NC University board member responsible for ousting Jones. Jones confronts O'Reilly in a parking garage but Supergirl arrives and O'Reilly shapeshifts into Martian Manhunter. Jones pushes them away and runs for it, but Supergirl and Martian Manhunter go to stop him. Jones grabs hold of both of them and starts sapping their powers, turning into a purple monster in the process. Alex and a D.E.O. team fend off Parasite and recover the two.
                    
                    In the infirmary, Alex explains that Kara will be able to recover from light therapy, but that J'onn lost too much blood and needs a blood transfusion. Alex realizes J'onn isn't the last Martian and leaves.
                    
                    Winn and James go to the storage room where Winn gives James his new suit. James says that this new identity is who he really is.
                    
                    Alex finds M'gann at the bar and asks for her help. While M'gann gathers her things, Alex spots Mon-El across the bar. Alex calls Mon-El a coward and that Kara believes in Mon-El's potential. Alex prompts him to stand with the rest of them and leaves with M'gann.
                    
                    When M'gann discovers that J'onn needs a blood transfusion from her, she tries to get out of it but Alex insists that J'onn needs her help. M'gann accepts and asks J'onn to forgive her.
                    
                    While riding a limo, Parasite attacks the real Rand O'Reilly. Mon-El distracts Jones and hurls a street sign at him. Parasite grabs him, but a grenade thrown by James, acting as a new vigilante Guardian, frees Mon-El. Guardian uses his shield to block Parasite's incoming punch. Kara wakes up and starts heading towards the battle. Mon-El saves a girl from a thrown car. Kara flies towards a nuclear reactor. Meanwhile, Guardian fends off Parasite. Supergirl arrives and makes Parasite absorb radioactive plutonium, causing him to explode. Kara commends Mon-El and Guardian for showing up to fight. After Kara fails to x-ray Guardian through his suit, Guardian leaves on a motorcycle.
                    
                    James and Winn commend each other for their efforts. James vows to continue helping people and tells Winn to keep it a secret from Kara.
                    
                    J'onn wakes up to M'gann sitting by his bedside. J'onn thanks M'gann and tells her to stay until he falls asleep. M'gann notices J'onn's hand shaking.
                    
                    Alex runs into Maggie at the bar and tells her that she came out to Kara. Alex then kisses Maggie, but Alex senses something is wrong. Maggie tells her that she shouldn't be involved with someone who is recently out and tells Alex she is here as a friend. Alex doesn't take it too well and leaves in tears. Kara finds Alex at her apartment. Alex tells her she made a mistake and that Maggie turned her down. Kara hugs Alex and tells her she is proud of her.
                    
                    While Mon-El is walking in the street, he happens upon a person coughing. He offers to help him out, but the guy pulls a tazer baton on him and a group of armed Cadmus agents kidnap him.</div>

                      Twenty-four hours earlier: Alex, Kara, Winn, and James hang out at Al's Dive Bar. A newsflash of Guardian appears on the bar's TV. Kara remarks that she disagrees with Guardian's efforts in the city, but James defends Guardian's actions. A brief flashback shows Guardian taking out 3 robbers. Kara doesn't like that Guardian wears a mask. However, Winn compliments the suit. Alex theorizes that Guardian has a partner. Another brief flashback shows Winn directing James as Guardian from a van. Alex then introduces the gang to Maggie. Maggie takes Alex aside and tries to clarify their relationship since they spoke last. She asks Alex if they can still be friends and Alex says yes. Afterwards, Alex asks Kara where Mon-El is. Kara assumes he is at some girl's apartment.
                      
                      Meanwhile, Mon-El is in a cage at Cadmus. He tries talking to the guard and gets the guard to aim a gun at him through the bars. Mon-El then disarms the guard and steals his keycard, using it to attempt escaping. Lillian Luthor appears at the doorway and threatens "J'onn" so Mon-El stands down.

                      Guardian takes out a liquor store robber and leaves him hanging. After Guardian leaves, another vigilante shoots the robber dead.
                      
                      The next day, James walks into CatCo to the news that Guardian has murdered someone. Snapper shows him surveillance footage of last night that seemingly implicates Guardian. Winn shows up and tells James to call off his vigilante activities. James refuses and vows to catch the gunman that night at the wharf.
                      
                      At the D.E.O., Kara catches J'onn meditating. J'onn tells her of his hallucinations. Kara tells him that she used to see visions of her family as a child and how Eliza helped her cope. She tells him that seeing M'gann may be causing him to reminisce.
                      
                      Guardian takes out some drug dealers at the wharf. The killer vigilante shows up and they both fight. However, the other vigilante gets away as the NCPD arrive. Guardian attempts to escape from them. While in bound to catch Guardian, Supergirl is telepathically contacted by Lillian Luthor telling her that Cadmus has Mon-El and to show up alone. Supergirl runs into Hank Henshaw, at first thinking it was J'onn. Henshaw says that Cadmus has saved him and that they now carry out his original goal of the D.E.O. to eradicate aliens. Supergirl punches Henshaw, but had minimal effect. Henshaw then proceeds to throw her into a wall. Kara blasts him with heat vision revealing his cyborg skeleton underneath. Henshaw repeatedly punches Supergirl and knocks her out.
                      
                      Alex asks Winn if he has heard from Kara. Winn assures her she must be at CatCo. Winn also tells her that Kara needs to lay off of Guardian. Alex says he's a murderer but Winn insists that he is not a murderer. Alex forces him to reveal that Guardian is James.
                      
                      Kara wakes up in a cage next to Mon-El. Kara tries to escape but Mon-El tells her the cage is made of Nth metal.
                      
                      Alex meets up with Maggie to tell her to drop the Guardian case. Maggie asks why since they're friends but Alex tells her they aren't friends. Alex confesses to Maggie that she was the one who convinced her that her feelings were real and to come out to Kara but that all she feels now is pain.
                      
                      Alex fails to contact Kara. J'onn advises to wait before panicking. J'onn then hallucinates seeing a White Martian and points a gun at it, but Alex talks him down after he realizes it's just another D.E.O. agent. J'onn tells Alex that something is wrong with him and to run tests.

Lillian tells her she blames Superman for turning the world against Lex and blames Superman and all aliens for poisoning Earth. Lillian then moves on to her purpose for kidnapping Supergirl: to get her to solar flare. She shoots Mon-El with a lead bullet and threatens to kill him if Supergirl doesn't cooperate. Supergirl gives in and agrees to solar flare into a specialized helmet. Lillian orders guards to take her away for experimentation. Lillian then takes a sample of her blood.
                      
                      Winn shows up to CatCo with a plan to catch the killer vigilante. Winn used his investigative skills to identify the other vigilante as Phillip Karnowsky and that he was targeting criminals who had gotten off due to judicial technicalities. Winn tells James he knows the next target.
                      
                      J'onn realizes that these are more than just simple hallucinations. Alex tests J'onn's blood and finds anomalies; his blood is white. J'onn says with bloodlust that he knows what happened and confronts M'gann outside Al's Dive Bar. M'gann admits that she is a White Martian but pleads to J'onn that she is not like the others. She tried to help Green Martians to safety but barely escaped with her own life. J'onn demands M'gann show her true form; they both morph into their Martian forms.
                      
                      Kara is put back into the cage. Kara tells Mon-El she's scared and that if she doesn't make it, to tell Alex to live her own life on her own terms. Mon-El says he deserves to die like the rest of his people but Kara says the prince sacrificed his life for his. Mon-El is about to admit something to Kara but Jeremiah arrives to take Kara away. Jeremiah takes out the lead bullet from Mon-El's leg and ushers them to a hallway. Jeremiah tells them he has to stay behind to slow them down. Kara tells him that Alex would never forgive her and hugs Jeremiah before he goes.
                      
                      J'onn repeatedly punches M'gann, each time saying it's for the people who died because of White Martians. After taking his many blows, M'gann takes to the sky, with J'onn following. She only deflects J'onn every time he attacks her. One deflect knocks him into the trash hard, but he gets up. Tired of J'onn using her as a scapegoat for his hatred for her kind, M'gann charges J'onn to reason with him. However, he grabs her and pins M'gann. Both revert to their human forms. J'onn demands her to change back so he can see his enemy die. Being choked, M'gann gives up; she will allow J'onn to kill her, but as Megan Morse, not the creature she despises being. He knocks her out and locks M'gann in the DEO.
                      
                      Guardian finds Karnowsky's victim tied up. Karnowsky arrives and opens fire on Guardian. Guardian uses the grappling hook to avoid the bullets but Karnowsky downs James with grenades. Karnowsky then moves to kill his target but James knocks him back. They get into a fist fight. Karnowsky pulls a gun on Guardian. Guardian pleads to Karnowsky that this isn't what his late wife would want, but Karnowsky calls him a fool and shoots him just as the NCPD show up. The bullets ricochet off the shield and Guardian uses his grapple to hurl Karnowsky to the feet of Maggie and Alex. Maggie lets Guardian go.
                      
                      Alex races back to the D.E.O. to see Kara. Kara tells her about Jeremiah's survival. Alex leads a strike team to the Cadmus hideout to find it has been cleared out.
                      
                      J'onn checks on M'gann's prison cell. J'onn refuses to listen to what she has to say but M'gann tells him that the blood transfusion is slowly turning him into a White Martian.
                      
                      Alex, Winn, and James show up to Kara's apartment with pizza and potstickers. They see the news exonerating Guardian of the murders so Kara fesses up to being wrong about Guardian. Kara tells Mon-El that he was brave and that there is a hero within him. Mon-El asks James and Winn if Kara is mated to anyone. They tell him no and that Humans mostly chose their own mates. Mon-El smiles while looking at Kara. Maggie shows up to the apartment and talks with Alex outside. Maggie says that she cares about Alex and that one day she hopes they can be friend. Alex invites her to play pool tomorrow night. Kara promises Alex that they will to find Jeremiah.

                      <div class="box">Kara is using her heat vision to defrost the Thanksgiving turkey. James and Winn tell Alex they are planning to tell Kara James is Guardian but Alex insists she has more important news. Mon-El arrives and charms Eliza. Kara thinks he is hitting on her but Eliza thinks he is doing it because he likes Kara. In the end, no-one is able to make an announcement because a portal briefly appears and disappears over the dinner table during the toasts.

                        Next day, Winn confirms to Supergirl and Alex at the DEO that something ripped the space-time continuum apart. J'onn reminds them that they still have the question of why Cadmus wanted Supergirl's blood. Alex and Winn want to hack Lena's files to see if she knows anything. Supergirl prefers to talk to her but they do the hack anyway. Kara visits Lena claiming to be doing an article about the influence powerful women's mothers had on them. Lena says she was never good enough for her mother. After Kara has gone, Lena meets with Lillian and tells her a reporter is asking questions about her. They also exchange awkward comments about Lillian never treating Lena like one of the family.
                        
                        Mon-El goes to the alien bar, where he shows no interest in an attractive alien female who tries to chat him up. A hooded Henshaw places a device under the bar. Mon-El follows him out and Henshaw overpowers him. The device releases a gas that kills all the alien patrons in the bar.
                        
                        Mon-El is placed in quarantine at the DEO while Alex and Eliza work on analysis the virus. J'onn also thinks he and Supergirl should stay there since the virus seems to affect non-humans. Supergirl keeps Mon-El occupied with a game and asks him if he has a crush on her. He denies it, then collapses. He is infected but not contagious: The virus gas needs to be breathed in. Eliza realises the virus is Kryptonian in origin. Supergirl realises her blood was taken to get access to the Fortress of Solitude. Supergirl flies to the Fortress and is attacked by Kelex, who has been reprogrammed to view her as an intruder: she destroys it. A simulation of Zor-El tells her that Project Medusa was a virus he created to defend Krypton from attack: If they were invaded, it could be used to wipe out all non-Kryptonians. Supergirl is disgusted and shares the news with her friends. Mon-El is still alive because of his similarity to Kryptonians but eventually the infection will kill him. Eliza tells Alex she already knows she's gay, because she knows when she's keeping secrets and because of the way she talks about Maggie. Eliza is fine with it.

                        Supergirl confides in J'onn about her disillusionment about her parents. J'onn tells her she is her true legacy. He partly transforms into a White Martian and tells her about the blood transfusion. He doesn't want anyone else to know, since they need to concentrate on Medusa. Alex and Eliza have checked the Kryptonian files and discovered a delivery system is used. The closest Earth analogy is Isotope 454, developed by L-Corp. Supergirl flies there while Alex asks Maggie to send a squad.
                        
                        Henshaw has already attacked L-Corp. Supergirl stops him harming a security guard and also Lena when he throws a chunk of masonry at her as she stumbles onto the scene. Henshaw gains the upper hand, which even Maggie's arrival with back-up doesn't change, but is distracted by another briefly appearing portal. He flees after wounding Maggie with his laser vision.
                        
                        Supergirl tells Mon-El it was her parents that created the virus. Mon-El kisses her, then passes out. Alex patches Maggie up and tells her about coming out to Eliza and how she's realised it is about being true to herself. Supergirl goes to see Lena and tells her about Lillian being the leader of Cadmus and releasing the virus, asking her to help find her. Lena accuses her of being another person who thinks the worst of Luthors, despite Supergirl insisting she thinks Lena is a good person. Lena meets with Lillian again, saying she knows about the virus and her sending Henshaw. She says Lillian only had to ask, producing a case of isotope 454.
                        
                        Winn detects the isotope being moved to the docks, the perfect place to release the virus from. Cadmus send out a message saying soon all non-humans will die. Supergirl and J'onn head to the docks alone. Lillian hands Lena the keys and, despite Supergirl's protests, she fires the rocket. Supergirl chases it while J'onn battles Henshaw, turning into his White Martian form. Supergirl catches the rocket but Lillian detonates it, releasing a massive cloud of the virus. Supergirl knocks out Henshaw but J'onn and the other aliens are unaffected: Lena switched out the isoptope, rendering the virus inert, and also contacted the police, who arrive to arrest Lillian. However, Henshaw has disappeared.
                        
                        On an alien spaceship, an underling reports that they have reached the Well of Stars but there is no sign of the Kryptonian pod. Two masked figures tell him to keep searching: Mon-El must be found.
                        
                        With a living sample of the virus, Eliza is able to not only cure Mon-El but also destroy J'onn's White Martian cells; he appears in his Martian Manhunter form. Mon-El pretends not to remember the kiss and Supergirl also doesn't tell him about it. Maggie visits Alex with pizza and tells her she's realised she needs to be true to herself as well. They kiss.
                        
                        Another portal appears in Kara's apartment, this time disgourging Barry and Cisco. Kara arrives and, after a round of introductions, Barry reminds her she offered to help him out some time. Kara asks what he needs.</div>

                        <h1 style="color:white">Arrowverse Crossover: Invasion!: The Flash: Season 3: Episode 8: Part 1</h1>
                        <div class="box">The episode starts with Barry and Oliver in trouble. 10 hours earlier, in S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry, Iris, Joe, Caitlin and Cisco are running tests on Wally, who is exhilarated about his speed and wants to get on with the real action. However, Iris and Joe deny it, because they believe he's not ready. Joe also intends to do something concerning Alchemy and Savitar. H.R. calls to present his idea about opening S.T.A.R. Labs to the public. However, his demonstration is cut, when satellite picks up what seems to be a meteorite heading to Central City. Barry races to the impact site and discovers it's actually an alien spaceship. Number of aliens emerge, frightening Barry.

                          The next day, Lyla Michaels is on the site, but the site has been declared closed to the public. Barry meets Lyla and she tells him to meet her at S.T.A.R. Labs. There, Lyla tells Team Flash, that these aliens have been on Earth before, during the 1950s, and they called them the Dominators. Back then they came to collect intel on humans, and it ended in conflict. For some unknown reason they left, and now Lyla wants to find out if the Dominators are here again for intel, or for something far more nefarious. Lyla tells Barry to sit still, but he's not going to.
                          
                          The scene changes to Star City, where Oliver and Diggle engage the Vigilante, when Barry suddenly speeds them out, before they are shot. They go to Felicity's apartment, and he informs them about the Dominators. Thea also joins. Barry also think about calling the Legends to help.
                          
                          In a secluded aircraft hangar owned by S.T.A.R. Labs, Team Flash and Team Arrow wait for the Legends to arrive, which they do in the Waverider's jumpship. So far, the Legends contain Sara, Stein, Jax, Ray, and Mick. Barry also intends to get an alien of their own for help, and he and Cisco open several breaches in order to reach Earth-38. They arrive in Kara Danvers' apartment in National City and Barry and Kara have a joyful reunion, and Kara immediately signs up.
                          
                          Barry, Kara, and Cisco rejoin the others on Earth-1, and Oliver mistakes Kara as a human, until she demonstrates her ability to fly without additional aid, and using her heat vision to create the House of El-symbol on the ground. Kara calls each of Team Arrow, Team Flash and Legends with their own names, and they reply with their hero names. Barry brings everyone up to speed about the Dominators, and Kara explains what she knows about them. Barry is chosen to be the leader since he gathered everyone. Oliver suggests for everyone to train so that Supergirl is their practice target. Stein and Jax pull Barry to discuss about something, and Oliver comes along too.
                          
                          Stein and Jax play a recording, which they found in a secret compartment of the Waverider. The message was meant for Rip Hunter. In the recording Barry explains that a war is coming and about his tampering with the timeline. To clarify this, Barry explains how he created the Flashpoint and explains some of the things that are new in the current timeline. Barry intends to tell everyone, but Oliver says they need to focus on the Dominators for now.
                          
                          Others train by attacking Supergirl, but their attacks are virtually useless against her (with Thea commenting Kara is a real badass and Sara saying it's hot). Oliver pushes everyone to keep on going. Later, Cisco and Ray are talking, when Barry interrupts them. Barry asks about Snart, and Ray reveals he sacrificed himself to save the others. Felicity notices that Cisco and Barry are tense, and Cisco admits he's mad at him, because his tampering with the timeline caused Dante to be dead. Stein asks Caitlin to go with him to see Clarissa, as Stein has memory changes, similar to what Barry experienced in Flashpoint. On the way Caitlin admits she is afraid of herself, due to Killer Frost inside her. They arrive at Stein's home, but instead of Clarissa, Stein meets Lily Stein, his daughter, whom he was unaware of.
                          
                          Lyla is meeting with the president, and he agrees with her on the Dominators. As the president leaves in his motorcade, the Dominators suddenly attack and kidnap him. Meanwhile, Cisco has found the recording, and is even more mad at Barry, when he intends to tell everyone about the Flashpoint after the Dominator threat is over. Angered, Cisco demands that Barry explain everyone about, what he did. With no other choice, Barry tells everyone about the Flashpoint, pointing to Diggle that he used to have daughter instead of a son. Sara is angry at Barry too, because as much as she would like to return to the past to save Laurel, she can't, because of the fact what it would cause to the timeline, and Ray also points to Barry, how the Legends have been fixing time aberrations, only for Barry to create one on his own. They get a call from Lyla that the president has been kidnapped, and are called to action. However, nearly everyone are reluctant to trust Barry, save from Oliver and Kara. Barry decides to sit this one out and Oliver stays with him, leaving the rest to be led by Kara. As they leave Barry asks Kara, does she trust him. Kara says she will always trust him, but it's going to require a lot more to regain the trust of others.
                          
                          Kara leads the team to an abandoned power plant. She scans the building with her x-ray vision, and sees the president, amazing everyone, especially Mick. Mick says he's not gonna call her Kara or Supergirl, but Skirt. The team enters the plant and encounter the president and one Dominator. Kara demands them to let the president go, but the Dominator claims he's not the one they want, and Diggle realizes they walked into a trap. The team is attacked and the Dominators activate a device, which affects all of them.
                          
                          Inside the time vault in S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry watches the article about him disappearing in the future (the article is not written by Iris in this timeline), and Oliver shows up. Barry feels down for making the mistake of Flashpoint, but Oliver tells him that he can't keep beating himself for causing it. Oliver then tells him about what happened, after the Queen's Gambit sank. It was only him, Robert and a fellow crew member. Robert killed him and himself and told Oliver to survive. Then, he tells Barry how he and Thea watched his mother, Moira, to be killed by Slade Wilson. These events have made Oliver to want to undo all of that, pointing out, that it is what anyone would want to do, when they lose something dear to them. Meanwhile, Iris still tells Wally, he can't go into the field. Suddenly, the Labs fall under attack and Cisco calls Barry and Oliver to action. The two emerge, only to find their friends are attacking, as they have been mind controlled. Barry runs to the roof in order to engage Supergirl, Firestorm and Atom, while Oliver keeps Speedy, White Canary, Spartan and Heat Wave busy. Barry knocks out Firestorm and Atom, but Supergirl knocks him down. Wally decides to go to help as he thinks Barry and Oliver have no chance against the others, especially with Supergirl around there. He manages to knock out Thea, Sara and Mick, but Supergirl knocks him out cold. Barry rejoins Oliver, and Cisco and Felicity tracked a strange power source coming from the team's last known coordinates. Barry says whatever there is, is controlling them, and intends to lure Supergirl there, as her strength should be sufficient to destroy it. Barry leaves Oliver to hold off the rest while he goads Supergirl to see, which one of them is faster. Supergirl chases Barry across the city, and Oliver takes Wally to safety, but he runs out of arrows. He is forced to fight Sara (Ta-er al-Sahref vs. Al Sah-him) head to head. Barry manages to lure Supergirl to the site and positions himself in front of the device. Supergirl charges at him, but he uses phasing, which causes Supergirl to fly through him, destroying the device. The mind control is broken and everyone are back to their old selves. Kara apologizes to Barry, but he says she's not the first superhero to be mind controlled.
                          
                          Iris and Joe scold Wally for what he did, and again deny him on going to the field. But H.R. offers to train him. The rest of the team are thankful for Barry and Oliver, while Kara scans the city for more Dominator devices. As Barry saved them, they are willing to stand with him. As they are leaving, Sara is suddenly caught in a beam, and she disappears. She is followed by Thea, Diggle and Ray. When beam hits Oliver, Barry attempts to save him, but he is too late.</div>

                          <div class="box">Oliver is seen running in the forests on the grounds of the Queen Mansion. He heads inside, where he meets and kisses Laurel, and they are about to be married. However, it is revealed that Oliver is actually living in an alternate reality, where he never became the Green Arrow, alongside Thea, John, Sara and Ray.

                            In the real world, at Arrowcave, Curtis, Rene and Rory are wondering, where Oliver is, when Felicity shows up along with Cisco Ramon. Cisco asks something of Oliver's in order to vibe, in order to find out, where Oliver and others are. Rene doesn't hide his disgust with meta-humans. Cisco learns, that they seem to be in some kind of alien spacecraft. Cisco hands them a piece of Dominator tech, hoping that decrypting it could provide more insight.
                            
                            Inside the false reality, Oliver is seemingly living his happy life, but as he talks with others and sees his parents alive, he starts having memory flashes about his true life. Robert takes Oliver to get a tuxedo. Sara helps Laurel with moving her stuff to the mansion, but she too, gets a memory flash, when she hugs Laurel.
                            
                            Back in Arrowcave, Curtis attempts to use his "3PO"-chip in order to download information on the alien device. It seems to work, but then it overheats, and device explodes. Felicity say they need a special kind of chip made for NASA, which has been stolen by dr. Laura Washington. Rene, Curtis and Rory are eager to go and get it from her, but Felicity feels they need backup, and calls for additional help.
                            
                            Oliver and Robert are walking in a back alley, where Robert tries to convince Oliver to take up a job at Queen Consolidated. When Oliver looks at a building called "Smoak Technologies", he feels something isn't right. Suddenly, they are attacked by a mugger, who demands their valuables. Robert tries to calm him down, but Oliver, without hesitation, steps in front of Robert. Just as the mugger is about to shoot Oliver, an arrow appears, and Green Arrow also appears and the mugger is taken by him. Oliver has more doubts about all of this.
                            
                            At the suspected location of Washington, Rene arrives late, since he didn't agree to be sped to the site with the Flash. Supergirl also drops in, but Rene disregards her. Inside the plant, Barry attempts to ask Rene about his problem, and Kara is also interested. Rene reveals that he despises meta-humans and anyone with superpowers, thinking that superpowers are bad. He goes in alone, and is attacked by Washington.
                            
                            At the mansion, Oliver's memory flashes become more frequent. He leaves for the police station. In the real world Rene fights Washington and is about to be hit, when Barry speeds him out of the way. He then begins speed punching her, and leaves her disoriented for Kara. Kara and Barry do a dual-strike by Kara throwing her, and Barry making a quick punch on her. Rory and Curtis are amazed and Rene thanks the two heroes, having now seen, that not everyone with superpowers are bad.
                            
                            At the police station, Oliver has a hearty talk with Quentin, and when Oliver sees a familiar sketch made from the Hood, Oliver starts to have flashes about him actually being the Green Arrow, and discovers the elevator to the Arrowcave. He goes there, and encounters Felicity, along with Green Arrow, who is John Diggle. Oliver tries to tell John about true things. John tells him to leave, which he does. In the rehearsal dinner for Laurel and Oliver's wedding, Sara meets with Ray. In this reality they never met before, but they both have flashes about their time together as Legends.
                            
                            Back at the real world, Curtis dubs Washington as Cyberwoman. They get to extracting the data with the chip they pulled from her. Meanwhile, Thea is having a talk with Moira and as she hugs her, she has a flash about Moira being killed by Deathstroke. Oliver returns to Laurel the next morning. She and Sara are disappointed, since he missed the rehearsal dinner. Oliver claims he wants to marry Laurel quickly. Diggle suddenly arrives, and the two head outside. Diggle says that after Oliver left, he too has had flashes about his real life. Both come to a conclusion, that the Dominators have trapped them in some kind of false reality, and agree that they need to get out from it. But Oliver thinks that if they do, the Dominators will attempt to keep them in here. Diggle asks how, and right after, Deathstroke appears to fight them. Oliver and John hold out, until Sara arrives and kills him, which leaves her wondering.
                            
                            The three return to the mansion, and Sara at first denies the possibility, but then Oliver asks her, what is the last thing she remembers. As she thinks, she remembers how she fought Oliver under mind control, and how she, Oliver, John, Ray and Thea were taken. All three now agree that what they are seeing isn't real and agree to get out. They think the Smoak Technologies building is their way out. But first, they need to get Ray and Thea.
                            
                            In the Arrowcave, all the team managed to get out from the Dominator technology is some senseless code. However, Rory says it's similar to Hebrew in Torah. Felicity decrypts it, and learns that it is giving coordinates, in negative form. Felicity realizes Oliver, Thea, John, Sara and Ray are in space, inside a Dominator Mothership.
                            
                            Oliver, John and Sara go to the party, where Oliver denies all this to his parents and gives them a hearty farewell. Sara meets with Ray and Ray realizes that he is also living in false reality. Sara also tells Thea, and when Oliver comes to her, Sara leaves the two alone. Thea doesn't want to leave this reality, and Oliver is seemingly unable to convince her. He meets others outside, where they run into projections of Oliver's enemies from the past: Malcolm Merlyn, Deathstroke, Damien Darhk and H.I.V.E. members. Thea also joins after realizing she can't lose her family: Oliver. The five heroes take on the projections and defeat them. Laurel arrives, and both Sara and Oliver give her a teary goodbye, with Sara finally accepting that she can't bring Laurel back, as some things can't be fixed.
                            
                            The heroes arrive at Smoak Technologies, where they find a portal. They exit, and as Oliver is about to leave, he hears his mother's voice. He turns around and sees visions of all the people he loves, with everyone saying what they said to him in the past about him being a hero. He leaves.
                            
                            All five wake up inside the Dominator ship and manage to board an alien ship to escape. As the attempt to leave, they are unable to fly the ship. The Dominators give pursuit, and things seem bad. Suddenly, the Waverider appears and throws the Dominators off and beams the heroes ship inside. Sara takes John to be fixed by Gideon and the rest go to the bridge. As Ray repeats what he heard the Dominators say, Gideon translates it and it roughly means, "The weapon is almost ready".

                            <div class="box">Oliver, Diggle, Sara and Ray return alongside Nate, Amaya and Mick to the S.T.A.R. Labs after escaping from the Dominator ship (and dropping Thea back to Star City). Barry, Kara, Cisco and Felicity are there welcoming them back. With the knowledge that the Dominators have some kind of weapon ready against Earth, the team decides to find out, what it is. After reviewing the footage from 1951, Nate decides to go with Amaya and Mick to the past to see if they can capture a Dominator there, and interrogate it. Cisco and Felicity, thrilled about time travel, also come along. Stein decides to go to S.T.A.R. Labs to reverse-engineer a piece of Dominator tech to see if he can create a counter measure for the Dominators. The team then receives a message, that the new President wants to meet them. Kara is thrilled, but Oliver tells her to remain behind, as he needs to feel normal after his ordeal from the Dominators. Kara reluctantly complies, but is angry with him for telling her this.

                              In S.T.A.R. Labs, Stein is attempting to create the tech with Caitlin's help. She notices Stein is having headaches, which don't seem normal. He needs some help and Caitlin has brought his daughter, Lily to help. Stein is reluctant to have her to help, due to the fact that she is a time aberration he created, and also he doesn't feel she is of any help. But after she tells him she has a degree from nanotechnology from MIT, he agrees, but is still uneasy for him to work with a daughter he doesn't even know.
                              
                              Nate, Amaya, Mick, Cisco and Felicity use the Waverider to travel to 1951. After arriving, the Legends tell Cisco and Felicity to remain behind as tech support. Outside, they encounter the site, where humans and Dominators are fighting. Realizing they can't intervene, they wait. Inside the Waverider, Felicity asks Cisco, why he chose to come along. As much as time traveling and seeing the Waverider was exhilarating, Felicity determines, that the actual reason was, that Cisco had to get away from Barry, as he is still mad for Barry creating Flashpoint, which caused his brother, Dante, to be killed, and Barry hasn't agreed to alter time to bring him back.
                              
                              Back in the present, Oliver, Barry, Diggle, Sara and Ray meet with the President's entourage, but there's no President with them. In fact, they are government agents. At the same time in 1951, Nate, Amaya and Mick encounter a lone straggler from the Dominators and move in to capture it. As soon as they overpower him, a group of agents appear, and their leader, Smith, captures the Dominator and them. The leader is the same leading the agents in the present. As the heroes take out the agents and corner Smith, he explains that they once had peace with the Dominators and that Barry broke it when he created Flashpoint. He tells them they made a deal with the Dominators: to hand over Barry, and they will leave Earth alone. Heroes knock him out.
                              
                              In the past, Cisco and Felicity realize Nate, Amaya and Mick are in trouble and they take guns along to rescue them Inside a prison, the Legends talk with the Dominator, who tells them they came to do reconnaissance on humanity to see if they would rise to become a threat. The Dominator is taken away for torture and at the same time Cisco and Felicity blast their way in. They agree to save the Dominator, hoping that saving him will get him to dissuade the Dominators invasion in the present. They succeed and the Dominator escapes, and the team returns to the present.
                              
                              In S.T.A.R. Labs, the overwhelm Stein experiences gets the better of him, and Caitlin doesn't understand, why he treats her daughter like a complete stranger. That is exactly the point, as to Stein she is a complete stranger. He then explains to Caitlin, how he caused a time aberration (in "Compromised") in 1987 by encouraging his younger self to be more close with Clarissa, and the result was Lily. Despite that, Caitlin tells him Lily is his daughter, and right now Stein needs her. Stein goes to see Lily, who is about to leave, and they agree to try again. Eventually, Stein begins to see she is his daughter.
                              
                              In the hangar, while Oliver is attempting to dissuade Barry from giving himself up, Nate realizes their time travel didn't seem to have any effect. Using the Dominator tech they brought with them, Cisco vibes with Nate, and they end up inside a Dominator ship. They encounter the Dominator they saved and he tells them that the emergence of meta-humans has made the Dominators deem, that they are a threat, and he now sees that Cisco is a meta-human as well. Cisco attempts to explain meta-humans protect Earth, but that doesn't help. The Dominators then declare their intent to drop their weapon, Meta-Bomb on Central City to annihilate meta-humans, not caring for collateral damage. As the vibe ends, Nate and Cisco realize they caused this, when they freed the Dominator in 1951. Having now seen first hand, what his meddling with time has caused, Cisco finally realizes the reason why Barry never agreed to save Dante, and how bad Barry feels, when he created Flashpoint: changing the past can make the present worse.
                              
                              Barry declares to everyone his intent of surrendering to the Dominators, as doing so will save everyone. As he is about to leave, Oliver tells him he will not allow Barry to do it. Barry wonders with what army, and Kara says this one, with the entire team behind her. Everyone (even Mick) tells Barry, that the team sticks together, and maybe the Dominators are right: they are villains, but this is their chance to find out. And after Cisco tells him Barry is his friend, Barry agrees. Stein arrives with a device, that can stop the Dominators, but they need to be attached to them individually. At the same time, the Dominators launch their forces and drop the Meta-Bomb. The team head out to engage them, while Sara and Cisco take the Waverider with the intention to stop the bomb.
                              
                              The heroes engage the Dominators, distracting them in order to allow Barry to attach Stein's devices on them. During the fight, Oliver is knocked down from the building, but he is saved by Kara, and without saying anything, thanks her. Sara and Cisco find the bomb and use a tractor beam on the bomb, but the bomb is too big for the beam: they only manage to slow down its descent. Felicity informs that there are still Dominators all over. Barry and Kara speed out to attach the devices on them. Sara calls out to Firestorm to help with the bomb, to transform it into something harmless. Jax believes he can't do it, but with Stein's encouragement, he manages to transform the bomb into water. As the final device is attached, Felicity activates them, and the invasion is stopped. The Dominators retreat and leave Earth.
                              
                              The new President holds an event, where she thanks the heroes for saving the planet. The heroes then have a victory party. Oliver, Barry and Kara (the three greatest of the Arrowverse), have a private talk about how they saved the world, as each one of them has saved it once before; Oliver saved the world, when he stopped Damien Darhk and H.I.V.E. by destroying Darhk's Genesis plan[1]; Barry saved the multiverse, when he defeated Zoom[2]; Kara saved her Earth from Myriad by lifting Fort Rozz out to space[3]. Oliver apologizes to Kara for his earlier behavior towards her, and they officially become friends. Kara then wants a group hug, which they do despite Oliver's reluctance. Later, Smith arrives, with the intention of covering up the incident. He gets cold reception from Nate and then Kara comes to tell her about the D.E.O on her Earth, and that she suggested to their president he be sent to Antartica. Getting the message, Smith is defeated clearly angry, and Nate tells him, that maybe now he will be more friendly to strange visitors from another planet.
                              
                              Cisco arrives with an interdimensional extrapolator for Kara, telling her she can use it whenever she feels or needs to come visit Earth-1. Kara thanks him and tells Oliver and Barry to call her if they ever need her help. Kara then opens a breach and returns to Earth-38.
                              
                              As the party ends, Oliver and Sara ponder what would their lives be, if they never had gotten on Queen's Gambit, reminiscing their experience while being captive by the Dominators. They agree it would be good, but not full. They hug as Sara leaves for the Waverider. Afterwards, Oliver and Barry are having a beer in a bar, and also ponder their lives. They both agree that their lives are not normal, but it is full with being heroes.</div>

                              <div class="box">Supergirl is chasing diamond robbers escaping in a van. They use surface-to-air missiles on her, but she manages to stop the van. However, she only apprehends the driver. The other two robbers are then caught up by the Guardian. He subdues one of them and the last one runs towards Winn's van. Winn manages to knock him down with the van door, but celebrates too early and the robber beats him up and nearly shoots him until Guardian comes to his aid. Elsewhere, a doctor shows a patient something.

                                At the DEO, Supergirl confines to Alex her frustration with the Guardian, but Alex knows, she is really frustrated by something else. She then reveals that she is getting bored, since she hasn't been helping people lately. Alex then goes to meet with Maggie.
                                
                                The next morning Alex is feeling happy for Maggie having stayed the night. At CatCo, Kara and James bring Snapper their stories about last night but he shows no interest. A woman then arrives to talk with Snapper and tells that her daughter, Izzy, is missing. Snapper isn't interested but Kara promises to find her.
                                
                                Kara goes to the Al's Dive Bar and is surprised to see Mon-El working there. When Mon-El failed to give her club soda, she goes to see Maggie for info about Izzy's disappearance. Maggie tells her that there have been around twenty mysterious disappearances in National City, but none of them seems to have any connection with each other. Maggie gives Kara a flash drive about the disappearances.
                                
                                Kara arrives at DEO to have Winn look at the flash drive. Winn tries to hide his last night's bruising with sunglasses, and Kara is shocked to see it. Winn says he got mugged. Alex arrives feeling happy, and Kara is happy about it. Winn learns that the disappearances actually have one thing in common. All of them had applied to a blood trial, and disappeared shortly after that.
                                
                                Kara is leaving CatCo to investigate, when Mon-El arrives. He decides to come with her, and Kara reluctantly agrees. At the blood trial, a doctor takes them in and shows them a portal. The doctor then transforms into an alien and his goons attempt to force Kara and Mon-El through the portal. They manage to beat them but the doctor escapes. Kara tells Mon-El to go to DEO and send a strike team after her. As Kara goes through the portal, she ends up in a different planet, and is attacked. She manages to beat the attacker but it leaves her bleeding. Another alien attacks her, but she is saved by Mon-El, who decided to come help her. Mon-El sees Kara's bleeding and Kara then points towards the planet's red sun, meaning she and Mon-El have no powers here. The portal then closes behind them.
                                
                                James arrives at the DEO to talk with Winn, but he refuses to speak with him or join for Guardian's next job. Alex arrives and asks if they have seen Kara. Winn says she is after a story. Alex takes a DEO squad to the blood trial and discovers the portal. J'onn recognizes it as a matter transfer portal, a way for an instant interstellar travel.
                                
                                At the other planet, Kara and Mon-El keep arguing as Mon-El urges them to leave, but Kara is determined to save the kidnapped humans, despite not having powers. Mon-El suddenly steps into a trap and Kara is unable to free him. An alien then appears and they surrender.
                                
                                At the DEO Winn has managed to discover the portal's destination. J'onn recognizes it as the planet Maaldoria, in the Arcturus system, the heart of intergalactic slave trade. Alex gets worried when J'onn tells her that Arcturus' sun is red sun. Things also goes worse when he also tells that Maaldorian atmosphere is toxic to Martians. Maggie arrives and Alex is unable to be with her for now, due to her worry for Kara.
                                
                                At Maaldoria, the alien who caught Kara and Mon-El, turns out to be a friendly nomadic Maaldorian named Jo, who surprisingly can talk in English. He reveals that they are in Maaldoria and Mon-El knows the planet, as Daxam used to buy it's slaves from there. Mon-El also insists to Kara that he never agreed with Daxam's slavery. Kara shows Jo Izzy's picture and he reveals she and other humans we're taken to the Red Fort. He also claims there is no way inside, but Kara says there is one: the front door. She and Mon-El go to the fort, pretending to have surrendered.
                                
                                Kara and Mon-El are taken to the cells, where the humans have been imprisoned. Kara promises to help them even without powers. Kara is then surprised to see Roulette, who reveals her that after she ruined her fighting club, she learned from one of the alien fighters about Maaldoria, and has started a slave trade between Earth and Maaldoria.
                                
                                At the portal on Earth, Alex is putting together a strike team and orders Winn to come along to make sure the portal stays open on the other side. Winn is scared out of his mind but Alex tells him that she too was terrified during her first time on the field.
                                
                                Humans are then to be taken away, but Kara puts herself in the line to protect the people. She gets a painful torture, which inspires the people to fight back. They overpower the Maaldorians and Kara and Mon-El forces the doctor and Roulette into the cell. They then start to flee.
                                
                                Alex, Winn and DEO squad arrive at Maaldoria. Alex leaves Winn behind to keep the portal open. As Kara leads the humans out, Mon-El uses a rifle to hold back pursuers. A tall alien then catches up to them. He stops Maaldorians from pursuing them after seeing Mon-El, bowing to him. The group flees and rendezvous with Alex. They flee back to the portal, where Winn is forced to fight a Maaldorian. He manages to grab a rock and knock out the alien, feeling exhilarated. Kara, Alex and Mon-El arrive with the humans. Humans flee the portal, but Maaldorians arrive with pursuit. Alex then throws a Yellow Sun Grenade J'onn gave her to give Kara a power charge. She manages to get the Maaldorians to retreat and they all escape, along with Jo. Kara destroys the portal controller.
                                
                                At CatCo, Kara takes Izzy to her mother and then delivers her report about Izzy's disappearance to Snapper. Snapper doesn't look interested, but Kara then explains that she wants to be a reporter, who follows stories she believes in. Snapper takes the article, and as Kara leaves, Snapper smiles to himself and says "'Atta girl, Danvers".
                                
                                Alex invites Maggie to her place and tries to explain herself, but Maggie reveals that she figured out that Supergirl is Kara, as Kara is the only person that would make Alex worry the way she did. Alex says she is sorry and Maggie gives her one chance to be serious about their relationship.
                                
                                Mon-El arrives at Kara's apartment with Club Soda, and Mon-El reveals that after today he has decided to become a superhero like Kara. Kara agrees with it as long as he listens to her.
                                
                                At Maaldoria, the hooded Daxamites arrive to question them about Mon-El's whereabouts. The doctor reveals that he's on Earth. Daxamites then kill him.</div>

                                <div class="box">Mon-El joins Supergirl in a training session involving protecting cardboard civilians from a drone, with mixed results. Maggie finds a group of criminals that Guardian left tied up for the police. Winn is somewhat freaked out that James received a minor bullet wound in the encounter and tells him they need to tell Kara.

                                  In her cell, M'gann hears voices and seems to go into a trance before collapsing. J'onn has Alex examine her. Even though there is nothing physically wrong with her, Alex senses she is mentally fading and will be brain dead within hours. At the local prison, Livewire is undergoing a session with a psychiatrist, Doctor Hampton. She says she will be out of there soon. A new guard attacks one of his colleagues and frees inmate Lisa Gold. The two of them then attack Hampton, to Livewire's delight.
                                  
                                  Kara joins Alex and Maggie in checking out the aftermath (causing Alex to win a bet with her girlfriend). She is vehement that Livewire is evil and needs to be stopped, even believing she abducted and killed the guard and inmate that disappeared with her. Winn later gives Supergirl, J'onn and Mon-El a briefing on Livewire. James calls Kara to his office and tries to suggest she doesn't have to fight Livewire alone but Kara thinks he is talking about Mon-El. They then see on the news that Livewire is attacking the NCPD. Supergirl and Mon-El (who has been given a superhero costume by Winn) confront Livewire but Supergirl is stunned to discover that it isn't Leslie but Lisa: She and the guard both have copies of Livewire's powers. Supergirl fights them both while Mon-El tries to get the police to safety, but with two-to-one odds she takes a beating. Mon-El rushes to help her and Guardian takes over his job of protecting the police, but both he and a police officer are injured by a stay blast before the two Livewires flee. Supergirl unmasks him and discovers it is James.

                                  After Alex has patched him up, Supergirl confronts James who says he needs to be a hero. Supergirl thinks he will get himself killed and threatens to stop him. Alex tells J'onn that he could save M'gann with the Martian bond but he is reluctant to open his meld to a White Martian. He later admits that he's not sure he can bring himself to stop hating her people. Kara asks Mon-El if he only wants to be a hero because he likes her.
                                  
                                  Although Supergirl believes Livewire is creating soldiers to serve her, in fact she is being held prisoner by a scientist who is draining her power. Winn shows Supergirl, J'onn and Mon-El security footage showing Lisa and the guard removing Livewire from the prison by force. He claims not to know where she is but in fact gives the information to James. Mon-El overhears.
                                  
                                  J'onn decides to help M'gann after all and asks Supergirl and Alex to stay with him while he mind-melds with her. He finds himself in an internment camp back on Mars. M'gann tells him that her fellows wanted her to kill a Green Martian boy but she let him go and then killed the other guards. She believes she will die there but J'onn reminds her she escaped to Earth. He says she is his friend and he forgives her.
                                  
                                  The scientist explains to Livewire that he isn't interested in teaming up with her but in creating super soldiers to sell. Guardian arrives, followed by Mon-El, who takes out the other two Livewires while Guardian tries to free Leslie. However, the scientist turns out to have Livewire's powers as well and knocks them both out. Winn contacts Supergirl and admits what he's done. The scientist intends to turn Guardian and Mon-El into more powerful super soldiers even though it will mean driving Livewire completely. Supergirl arrives and frees Guardian and Mon-El to fight the two soldiers while she frees Livewire. Livewire threatens to kill her but Supergirl points out she made Livewire who she is and the scientist tried to take it away from her. Livewire fights him instead while Supergirl helps her friends. Supergirl tells Livewire not to kill the scientist, saying she can't guarantee she won't go back to jail, but if Livewire shows mercy she'll wait before chasing after her. Livewire accepts and departs.

                                  Back at the DEO, J'onn reprimands Winn for withholding information although she is quietly impressed. Supergirl tells Alex and Maggie she let Livewire go because there was still good in her (causing Maggie to win a bet) and tells James and Winn she doesn't support them but won't stop them. J'onn tells M'gann she's free to go. M'gann tells him she withdrew into herself and became trapped while trying to shield herself from her people: Now they know where she is and will be coming.
                                  
                                  Kara finds Mon-El at her flat. He tells her she was right: He remembers kissing her when he thought he was going to die and cares about her. He says he knows she doesn't care about him in the same way and is happy just to go on working with her. Kara looks more conflicted.</div>

                                  <div class="box">On her 13th Earth Birthday, Kara arrives at the Al's Dive Bar, and Mon-El gives her a club soda with rocks. Mon-El is still trying to get a relationship with Kara, but Kara is not convinced they would be compatible (likely due to them being a Daxamite and a Kryptonian, respectively). Alex arrives and Kara tries to get her to celebrate her birthday, but Alex says she has plans with Maggie - to go to a Barenaked Ladies concert. Kara tells them to go. M'gann sees that Kara is feeling down. When M'gann is taking trash outside, J'onn shows up. Though M'gann claims she can take care of herself, J'onn insists on looking after her. When M'gann says there are no White Martians here, they are suddenly attacked by one. Kara comes to their aid and it flees.

                                    J'onn insists keeping M'gann safe at the D.E.O., but she refuses. Back at the bar, M'gann gets a visit from her former mate, Armek. He gives her two hours to surrender, or else he starts hurting her friends. M'gann stands her ground and Armek leaves. Alex is feeling guilty, having turned Kara down, which Maggie notices. Maggie urges Alex to talk with Kara.
                                    
                                    M'gann tries to leave in an attempt to keep her friends safe, but J'onn convinces her to let them protect her, and takes her to D.E.O. At the D.E.O., Kara is surprised that Winn is still at work, thinking he was helping Guardian with something. Kara shows her concern for Winn, because she doesn't want to see him hurt, but Winn claims that it is his calling. Alex talks with Kara, but Kara tells her to be with her girlfriend. J'onn and M'gann arrive, but soon after a second M'gann arrives. Everyone soon realizes that the "M'gann" that came with J'onn is actually Armek in disguise. He attacks J'onn and Kara, and the fight causes the power to go out. Winn manages to restore auxiliary power, but Armek is gone. J'onn locks down the building to keep Armek trapped. However, since the White Martians can adopt anyone's appearance, all people inside now face a problem: which one of them is actually Armek? J'onn is unable to sense it due to psychic interference.
                                    
                                    As the D.E.O. agents start accusing each other of being a White Martian, J'onn breaks it up and reveals that there is a way to reveal a white Martian: fire. He sets up a blowtorch in the lab and has everyone put their hand near it, as M'gann demonstrates that close proximity to fire reveals a White Martian in disguise. Vasquez and Demos go first and they are cleared. J'onn goes next. He initially hesitates due to his pyrophobia, but his Green Martian skin is revealed, clearing him too. Kara then orders Winn to go next. He hesitates, until he drops the charade and reveals himself as a White Martian. He knocks Kara and J'onn out and flees.
                                    
                                    As D.E.O. agents begin a search and destroy operation, Armek sets the building's nuclear reactor into a meltdown. This is possible because when White Martians take a form of another, all their victims' properties are transferred psychically, thus Armek has Winn's know-how to overload the reactor. They also need to be at close proximity with the victim to maintain the psychic link. Alex says they have to find Winn, as he is the only one able to stop the reactor from melting down. J'onn orders Kara and Alex to the basement while he and M'gann search other floors.
                                    
                                    In the basement Kara reveals to Alex that she was mad, when Alex bailed from her birthday. Kara says that she felt abandoned. Alex assures her that she will never abandon her, and they reconcile. J'onn and M'gann find Winn trapped in the ceiling, but to their horror they find Alex there too, indicating that there are two White Martians in the building. J'onn contacts Kara and tells her that the other White Martian has taken Alex's appearance. "Alex" then attacks Kara.
                                    
                                    J'onn and M'gann revive Alex and Winn. J'onn takes Winn to the reactor, where Kara is fighting with "Alex". "Alex" taunts Kara for fighting her sister, but Kara is not fooled. J'onn and Winn arrive at the reactor room, where Kara is already fighting. Winn starts to work on shutting down the reactor, despite the chaos around him. Armek is also there and he engages J'onn, with M'gann coming to J'onn's aid in Green Martian form, ultimately declaring that White Martian skin is a monster. Kara is able to subdue the other White Martian, and M'gann kills Armek. Winn manages to shut down the reactor with twelve seconds to spare. As they are leaving, the other Martian raises and tries to attack, but the real Alex arrives and kills it with her alien gun she took from Maaldoria, declaring that she loves it.
                                    
                                    The lockdown is released and Kara says she is proud of Winn. Winn then decides to go and see if James needs his help, unless Kara objects. To his surprise, Kara lets him go, and smiles happily. Alex then remembers her date with Maggie and runs. Later, M'gann and J'onn share a moment. M'gann intends to return to Mars in order to reform the White Martians, convinced that there are others like her. J'onn lets her go.
                                    
                                    At Kara's apartment, Alex arrives with a cupcake, which is Earth Birthday-tradition for the sisters. Kara and Alex then have a conversation about how Kara felt abandoned with Alex bailing, despite all the plans she made. However, Alex believes that Kara made all those plans so that she wouldn't have to think about her feelings towards Mon-El, finally realizing she cares about Mon-El more than just being a trainer for him. The next day at CatCo, Kara and Mon-El run to each other. Kara tries to ask Mon-El for a date, but unfortunately he is already taking Eve for a date. Kara lets them go and she feels down again for losing her chance.</div>

                                    <div class="box">In a flashback to twenty years ago, Lillian Luthor is teaching her son Lex chess. Lionel arrives home with newly adopted Lena, which Lillian is apprehensive to at first. Lex offers to teach Lena chess which causes Lillian to warm up to the idea of Lex having a sister.

                                      In the present, Kara and Mon-El are at Al's Dive Bar watching a newscast of Lillian's upcoming trial and awkwardly catch up with each other. Kara then meets up with James, Winn, and J'onn. Alex arrives and introduces Maggie to the group as her girlfriend. Mon-El brings over drinks and congratulates the couple. Maggie challenges Winn to a game of pool. Kara and James discuss the trial. Kara defends Lena's actions, but James is convinced that Lena is using Kara.
                                      
                                      Later, Kara visits Lena to comfort her and bring her donuts. Kara advises her to go see her mother, despite the rift between them.
                                      
                                      Lena visits her mother in prison. Lena tells Lillian that growing up, she felt unwanted and like an outsider to the family. Lillian tells Lena that Lionel had an affair with her biological mother. After she died, the Luthors adopted her but Lionel did not like Lillian spending time with Lena so she focused on Lex. Now, Lillian wished to have a second chance with Lena. Meanwhile, John Corben receives a package of kryptonite in prison.
                                      
                                      At the trial, Corben is being cross-examined. He claims Cadmus saved him and that aliens should be wiped from Earth. He proclaims that Lillian wants to save them all but Supergirl silenced her. Corben then fires a kryptonite beam at the prosecutor and frees Lillian. Supergirl tries to stop them but Corben fires a beam, destroying a crane. Supergirl is forced to save the people from the falling crane as the two get away.
                                      
                                      Later, Maggie is telling Kara and Alex that the prison only had one visitor last night, Lena Luthor. Kara goes to Lena and tells her of the situation, but Maggie and the NCPD show up and arrest Lena due to damning security footage showing her taking kryptonite out of her safe.
                                      
                                      Kara walks into CatCo in chaos. James tells her they are crashing the cover and putting Lena on the cover. Kara defends her friend to James and Snapper, but James sides with Snapper, believing that Lena is deceiving Kara. Kara bumps into Eve, who tells her that she and Mon-El broke up because he would only talk about Kara during their dates.
                                      
                                      Corben arrives and breaks Lena out of prison. Guardian tries to intervene but Corben overpowers him and escapes with Lena.
                                      
                                      Alex tends to James's wounds at the D.E.O. infirmary. James informs them that something was wrong with Corben's kryptonite core. Kara promises them that she will save Lena. James and J'onn insist she is guilty. James talks about Clark and Lex's history and prior friendship. He asks Kara why she isn't willing to trust him, but Kara leaves.
                                      
                                      Mon-El catches Kara venting in the training room. He tells Kara that he admires her ability to believe in the good in others that other people don't. Kara admits that she was mad that Mon-El was dating Eve, but when he asks her why she leaves without answering.
                                      
                                      In the back of a Cadmus truck, Lena is angry that Lillian freed her. Lillian assured her that the public wouldn't have believed her anyway. She pleads for Lena to join Cadmus. Meanwhile, Corben's condition worsens. They arrive at Lex Luthor's mountain vault, with Lillian explaining that Lex kept caches stored with technology that could stop Superman. Lillian tells Lena about how any Luthor can open the vault. Lena then realizes that Lillian only freed her to open the vault. She refuses to open it for them, but Hank Henshaw forces hand onto the scanner, opening Lex's stash.
                                      
                                      At the D.E.O., Winn discovers that Cadmus hacked the security footage to make it appear as if Lena took kryptonite from the safe to frame her. The real culprit was Henshaw. They scan for and find a kryptonite signature in the mountains. The scans also show that the kryptonite is synthetic and decaying rapidly. Kara races off to save Lena.
                                      
                                      Cadmus plunders Lex's vault. Lillian discovers one of Lex's finished projects stored in a small cube. Supergirl arrives to stop them, but Lillian disables her with a sonic grenade. Corben's kryptonite heart starts fluctuating. He fires a kryptonite beam at Supergirl and holds her hostage. Martian Manhunter arrives on the scene and saves Supergirl. Supergirl grabs Lena and they escape just as Corben goes critical and explodes.
                                      
                                      The next day, Kara arrives at CatCo and gloats to Snapper about being right about Lena. Snapper brushes it off and tells Kara to get them an exclusive with Lena. James apologizes to her for being wrong about Lena. Kara tells him that she wants them to be friends again. They both agree on a game night. At Lena's office, Lena thanks Kara for the favorable story and being there for her when no one else was. After Kara leaves, Lena reminisces to twenty years ago about beating Lex at a game of chess as she stares at her office chessboard in present day.
                                      
                                      Mon-El arrives at Kara's apartment and explains that they are both really different but that despite his flaws, Mon-El proved her wrong about him. They nearly kiss, until a portal opens and Mxyzptlk interrupts them, professing his love for Kara.</div>

                                      <div class="box">As Kara and Mon-El are baffled about Mr. Mxyzptlk, he immediately starts swooning over Kara and when Mon-El attempts to make him stop, Mxy teleports Mon-El to the DEO, where he resolves to kill Mxy. Mxy proposes to Kara and even puts her in a wedding dress. Kara is finally able to refuse his proposal, but Mxy only believes she is playing hard to get, and then leaves, returning everything normal.

                                        At the DEO, Mon-El reveals that similar creatures have been on Daxam before, and whenever they showed up, they killed them. Kara refuses to do that and J'onn has Winn look about him and see if DEO has anything that could help against Mxy. Kara also assures Mon-El that she can handle him.
                                        
                                        Alex and Maggie are spending time together and Maggie reveals how she hates Valentine's Day. Alex says the same, but in truth she likes it, just as Kara does.
                                        
                                        The next day, an armed robbery takes place and Kara swoops in to stop it as Supergirl. Suddenly Mxy appears and telekinetically turns the robbers guns against them, forcing Kara to jump in front of them so that Mxy won't kill them. Mxy claims that he can give Kara anything she wants and assist her with anything, but if she doesn't marry her, he will unleash more chaos.
                                        
                                        Later, Alex asks Kara for tips about how to spend Valentine's Day with Maggie, as she hates it. Winn had discovered some things that could help against Mxy, including an amulet that supposedly severs Mxy's connection with the Fifth Dimension. Mon-El becomes intrigued by it.
                                        
                                        The following evening Alex tries to surprise Maggie, but she walks away disgusted. Kara and Mon-El are spending their evening in her apartment, when they suddenly hear ruckus outside. They look from the window and see the Parasite wreaking havoc. Both race down to deal with it, but they get knocked out. Suddenly, above everyone, a man is seen flying, which seems to be Superman. He takes out the Parasite and lands, but it's actually Mxy wearing a similar suit as Superman. Kara and Mon-El realize that he conjured the Parasite in order to show off for Kara. Mon-El loses his temper and tries to get Mxy to spell his name backwards, which baffles Kara. Mxy again sends Mon-El away and gives Kara a final warning: marry him or face the consequences.
                                        
                                        At the DEO, Kara scolds Mon-El for not telling her that getting Mxy to say his name backwards is a way to defeat him. Mon-El reasons that it never works, since Mxy isn't stupid. Kara then tells Mon-El to leave this as she handles this alone. Mon-El then takes the amulet and races to face Mxy himself. As Kara is starting to conclude that maybe Mon-El is right. J'onn discovers that the amulet is missing. Kara instantly realizes Mon-El took it.
                                        
                                        Mon-El finds Mxy and challenges him. Mxy teleports them into a theater wearing suits from 18th century and muskets. Mon-El shoots him, but the gun is not really loaded. Mon-El uses the amulet, which prevents Mxy to use his abilities, but in the end it's no use, as Mxy is able to subdue him. Kara arrives just as Mxy is about shoot Mon-El with a lead bullet. Kara seemingly gives up, and agrees to marry Mxy, just as long he lets Mon-El go. Mxy immediately prepares for the ceremony, but Kara gives him a condition that they will marry tomorrow at the Fortress of Solitude, where she can wear her mother's dress. Mxy agrees.
                                        
                                        The next day Mon-El arrives at Kara's apartment and tries to convince Kara not to marry Mxy, but Kara is adamant and claims it wouldn't work with them, and that Mxy's powers could be helpful for her as Supergirl and Mon-El leaves.
                                        
                                        At the Fortress of Solitude, Mxy arrives but Kara isn't there yet. She finally arrives in her Supergirl suit with a glass of orange juice. As Mxy wants to get on with the wedding, Kara rejects him, and says she never intended to marry him; rather she played him in order to trap him inside the fortress, so he wouldn't hurt anyone else. Mxy gets angry and animates the statue of Jor-El to attack Supergirl. She destroys it while apologizing to her uncle. Then, Kara sets the Fortress' reactor core to self-destruct. Mxy believes she is bluffing, but Kara is dead serious that she would rather die than marry him. Mxy demands the override code but Kara doesn't give it. As time is running out, Mxy starts panicking as he can't figure out the override code himself. Finally, Kara shows it to him and Mxy types it himself. The self-destruct sequence stops and Mxy is relieved, but Kara then shows that the override code was Mxy's full name spelled backwards. Outraged that Kara managed to trick him, he tries to attack her, but the effect of the spelling is starting to take effect. As Mxy disappears, he says that all he ever wanted was to have someone to love him, but Kara says that love can't be forced on anybody; it needs to come on its own.
                                        
                                        Alex arrives at her apartment, where she finds a note and a gift from Maggie. Putting on the dress and going to the place Maggie had told, Alex then gets her own prom.
                                        
                                        At Kara's apartment, Mon-El arrives and is amazed that Kara managed to trick the most notorious trickster in the universe. As they talk about what happened, Mon-El, thinking that Kara was serious when she said those things to him, is going to leave Kara for good, but Kara stops him and admits she didn't mean it; she just said those things to protect him, and Mxy could have been listening. Kara and Mon-El are then finally able to do what Mxy interrupted and kiss, turning it into a passionate moment between the Kryptonian and the Daxamite.</div>

                                        <div class="box">Mon-El awakes in Kara's apartment after the events of the last episode and notices she is not in bed with him; he briefly wonders if she took off because he was a bad lover, but changes his mind to wonder if he was too good. She soon arrives from the window, having dealt with little trouble and getting a morning lattes for them. Kara wants to keep their relationship between them for now, but at the D.E.O., Mon-El announces it to everyone, leaving Kara somewhat embarrassed.

                                          D.E.O. then receives an alert about a Cadmus convoy. Kara and J'onn fly in to intercept it, and manage to stop it. From the convoy's wreckage, they find Jeremiah Danvers, beaten but alive. Kara, Alex and J'onn are happy that he's alive and back, but Mon-El is suspicious.
                                          
                                          Jeremiah is brought to the D.E.O., where he is examined. He seems to be alright, except he has trouble using his left arm. He informs the D.E.O. that Cadmus has a fusion bomb they intend to use to wipe out aliens. Kara and Alex organize a homecoming party for him, in which all their friends are invited, along with Eliza. Things go well, until Mon-El arrives. Believing that Jeremiah's rescue was too easy (pointing out that he was lost for 15 years and even the D.E.O. couldn't find him, and then suddenly he lands on their lap), he openly starts to accuse him of fooling everyone. Kara and Alex are forced to throw Mon-El out, unwilling to even doubt their father. Jeremiah also tells Mon-El that he knows who he is, and that Kara won't like the truth.
                                          
                                          The next day, Mon-El meets Winn at Al's Dive Bar and asks him to watch over Jeremiah, as J'onn has agreed to enlist him back to the D.E.O. Winn is first unwilling, but agrees. As soon as J'onn gives Jeremiah access rights to the DEO, Winn sees him accessing the mainframe, for which he doesn't have access rights. Alerted by this, he informs Mon-El and he asks Winn to bring Kara to the training room.
                                          
                                          Kara arrives and as soon as she sees Mon-El, she tries to walk away, but both Mon-El and Winn manage to get her to listen. Winn tells Kara what he saw Jeremiah do, and Kara starts to realize that if Jeremiah can access the mainframe, when he doesn't have authorization, there's no telling what he might acquire from it, or do to D.E.O. Now also suspicious, Kara gets Alex and with Mon-El and Winn along, she goes to see Jeremiah. J'onn is also there, and also becomes intrigued, when Winn tells him about Jeremiah's intrusion to the mainframe. Jeremiah claims that he was interested about DEOs earlier operations, getting in the speed about what has been going on ever since Kara and Alex joined DEO. Winn says his story checks out. Alex is angry towards Kara, Mon-El and Winn for suspecting her father.
                                          
                                          Despite what happened, Kara, Mon-El and Winn don't let go of their suspicions. Kara tries to convince Alex that he may have ulterior motives; after all, he was with Cadmus for 15 years. Alex shoots Kara down and can't believe that she of all people would suspect the man, who is her father and the one who raised Kara as well.
                                          
                                          The following night, Jeremiah learns that Cadmus has activated the fusion bomb. Kara, Alex and Mon-El, along with a D.E.O. strike team, race to the coordinates: all they find is an empty warehouse. Everyone realize it was a setup, and Kara and Mon-El immediately realize Jeremiah has betrayed them. J'onn witnesses Jeremiah leaving. He follows Jeremiah to the mainframe and Jeremiah manages to download something from it. J'onn, angered at Jeremiah's betrayal, and also wondering why he was unable to sense anything strange from him, attacks him, but Jeremiah is able to fight him: turns out his left arm wasn't injured; rather it was replaced with a cyborg arm, which gives him extra strength. He knocks J'onn out, shoots the mainframe, and escapes.
                                          
                                          Kara and Alex chase after Jeremiah, and find him interacting with Lillian Luthor, confirming Mon-El's suspicions: Cadmus intended to have D.E.O. "rescue" Jeremiah, so that he could access the mainframe. As the sisters prepare to take them out, Lillian has a nearby train bridge destroyed. A train approaches and Kara is forced to go help it. Alex chases after Jeremiah. Kara is able to weld the railway track back into place, using herself as support as the train passes it. Alex catches Jeremiah, and she demands to know, why he did this. Jeremiah claims he did it for her. Alex can't bring herself to shoot Jeremiah and he leaves, leaving devastated Alex behind.
                                          
                                          Back at the D.E.O., everyone are shocked about Jeremiah's betrayal, especially Alex. J'onn tasks Winn to find out, what it was that Jeremiah stole. Back at her apartment, Kara lies on the sofa, devastated about his adoptive father's betrayal. Mon-El arrives, but he doesn't boast for being right about Jeremiah. He goes to Kara, and Kara asks him to hold her. Winn calls her and tells her that Jeremiah stole the National Alien Registry. This will allow Cadmus to find every registered alien in the country. Putting her grief aside, Kara tells Mon-El they need to go.
                                          
                                          In a secret location, the fusion bomb turns out to be a fake. Jeremiah gives Lillian the drive he used on the D.E.O. mainframe, and it is revealed that Cadmus has a massive spacecraft.</div>

                                          <div class="box">The scene opens with a family getting pulled over by a cop for a broken tail light. The cop offers to help fix it, however it turns out it's a Cadmus trap. The family are aliens and they are forced in the back of a Cadmus van.

                                            Back at the DEO, Winn tells Supergirl and the remainder of the group about the most recent Cadmus kidnapping, which is the 26th in a week. Winn suggests that Jeremiah has shown Cadmus how to sneak by the DEO's radar, so J'onn proclaims Jeremiah a rouge. In the interim, Supergirl needs to caution National City's alien populace about Cadmus' danger, so she offers to compose an article for CatCo to get the word out.
                                            
                                            However, Snapper won't run Kara's article, as she just has one source for the story. Kara recommends that, in lieu of a second source, Snapper interviews Supergirl right away.
                                            
                                            At the alien dive bar, Alex fixates on why her dad turned on the DEO. Alex is persuaded that Jeremiah has a ulterior thought process in favoring Cadmus and Maggie says that when the DEO discovers him, Alex will be there to secure him. In the mean time, Winn acquaints Jimmy with his girlfriend Lyra. Cadmus out of nowhere assaults the bar and grabs Lyra and the remainder of the aliens, despite the fact that Maggie, Alex, Jimmy, and Winn all set up a battle. On account of Guardian, they do figure out how to catch one of the Cadmus goons before they escape.
                                            
                                            Back at the DEO, Winn goes nuts about losing Lyra. He even ventures to undermine Jeremiah, however Mon-El attempts to quiet him down. Alex in the mean time makes a beeline for the cells and fires thrashing the Cadmus goon to get him to talk. J'onn rushes in and stops Alex before she kills him. A short time later, Alex says she's fine, yet J'onn looks a long way from persuaded.
                                            
                                            Supergirl meets with Snapper to affirm Kara's story. Be that as it may, Snapper needs Supergirl's source, even in private. Since Supergirl won't uncover the DEO's presence, Snapper will not move.
                                            
                                            Jeremiah appears at Alex's condo and says that Cadmus is set up to execute all the aliens, but that Alex can stop them by getting an attractive field disruptor from the DEO's vaults. When Alex consents to help, Jeremiah changes into J'onn and says that it was a test...a test she didn't pass. J'onn suspends Alex until the current emergency is finished.
                                            
                                            The REAL Jeremiah discloses to Lillian that Exodus is practically prepared, as Cadmus drives the aliens into an enormous looking spaceship.
                                            
                                            Alex asks Kara to have J'onn returned working on this issue, yet Kara believes that Alex is undermined as well. Kara guarantees that nothing will happen to Jeremiah, yet she rushes out before Alex can get a word in. While Kara won't help Alex, Maggie says she will and asks where they should begin.
                                            
                                            Kara runs into Lena at CatCo (they should eat) and Kara vents to her about Snapper. Lena proposes that Kara just compose a blog warning the aliens, in spite of the fact that Kara takes note of that Snapper would kill her. Kara likewise approaches Lena for help finding the missing outsiders, utilizing either L-Corp innovation or pieces of information abandoned by her mom.
                                            
                                            Alex and Maggie snare the Cadmus trap group and take a GPS out of the Cadmus van. Alex says she can discover Cadmus now, yet she discloses to Maggie she needs to do this by itself.
                                            
                                            While going through L-Corp's financials, Lena understands that an as far as anyone knows shut down maritime site her organization possesses was dynamic. Her aide (a Cadmus sleeper) contacts Lillian, who advises her to "divert" Lena away from their arrangements.
                                            
                                            Alex discovers Cadmus' base, yet rapidly gets captured. Jeremiah strolls up and says that Alex is with her. Jeremiah clarifies that Cadmus isn't executing the aliens: they're sending them once again into space. He additionally discloses that Cadmus took steps to murder Alex and Kara except if he consented to support them.
                                            
                                            Mon-El advises Kara to distribute her article, since it's the best activity. Directly after she distributes it, Lena gets and says she made sense of where Cadmus is...right before some Cadmus goons assault her in her office. One of the goons coincidentally pushes Lena off her office's overhang, yet Supergirl dips in to make all the difference.
                                            
                                            Back at Cadmus, Lillian pushes up the course of events for Exodus in the wake of perusing Kara's article. Alex uncovers that she planted bombs on the office and requests that her father stop the Exodus dispatch. Jeremiah concurs, however Lillian claims its absolutely impossible to stop the dispatch. Alex sheets the boat to attempt to prevent the dispatch from within, while Henshaw ambushes Jeremiah.
                                            
                                            On the boat, Alex liberates the alien detainees and advances toward the cockpit. Be that as it may, an auxiliary door craps the detainees in as the spaceship takes off into the environment. Alex calls Winn for help to land the boat, while Supergirl flies in to help moderate the boat down.
                                            
                                            Back at Cadmus, Henshaw beats Jeremiah by utilizing his laser vision.
                                            
                                            The alien ship's automated defenses begin firing at Supergirl, yet she freezes the firearms and attempts to genuinely back the boat off from the front. Supergirl utilizes crude power to short the boat's motors directly before it dispatches into lightspeed.
                                            
                                            Winn reunites with Lyra at the alien dive bar, however Kara's arrival to CatCo isn't close to as fortunate. Snapper fires Kara for running the story, despite the fact that she wound up being correct.
                                            
                                            Alex's gathering with her manager goes much more easily. J'onn apologizes to Alex and says he was just attempting to secure her. Alex gets formally restored.
                                            
                                            Mon-El carries potstickers to Kara's loft to comfort her about losing her employment. Kara says she adored her activity, yet Mon-El says that she has such a great amount to offer the world. Kara says that perhaps simply being Supergirl and dating Mon-El is sufficient.
                                            
                                            The scene closes with two hooded aliens who look simply like Kevin Sorbo and Teri Hatcher showing up at Earth on their monster risky spaceship.</div>

Meanwhile, aliens hack into National City's TV networks, demanding Earth turn over Mon-El of Daxam. The D.E.O. analyzes a spaceship in orbit. Meanwhile, Winn and Lyra are at the National City Art Gallery. Lyra bribes Winn with museum sex to get him to break into the art museum.

                                              Supergirl flies up to confront the spaceship. The cruiser opens fire on Supergirl. She retaliates with heat vision, but it is stopped by the ship's shields. The ship then fires a force field bubble trapping Supergirl and sending her plummenting below. She breaks free just before the bubble crashes into the ground and flies back up. Before things escalate, Mon-El turns himself over to the invaders. Kara protests letting him go alone, but he assures her that he will be okay. As Mon-El is being beamed up, Kara joins him at the last second and the two of them arrive on the spaceship. The guards bow down to Mon-El and he reunites with his parents. Rhea and Lar Gand apologize to Supergirl for "defending" themselves, claiming that Supergirl was attacking them. Mon-El then introduces his parents as the Queen and King of Daxam to Kara and that he is the Prince. A shocked Kara is invited to dinner with the family.
                                              
                                              While singing at the D.E.O., Winn is summoned by Maggie to the NCPD station. Maggie interrogates him about an art theft last night at the art gallery. Surveillance footage seems to frame him for stealing Starry Night since Lyra isn't in the camera footage.
                                              
                                              At dinner, Rhea and Lar Gand talk about their quest to find Mon-El and how they heard of his exploits on Slaver's Moon. They ask Mon-El to come back to help restore Daxam. Kara asks how he really escaped Daxam's destruction. Mon-El tells them of how he woke up to the crisis, a palace guard ushered him outside and killed a Kryptonian emissary, and commandeered his ship for Mon-El to escape. Kara then leaves dinner, furious with Mon-El.
                                              
                                              At the NCPD, Maggie is still questioning Winn when Alex and James arrive to the station. Maggie reveals that Lyra being a Valerian menas she has the ability to remain invisible to video cameras and that she used this ability to set Winn up. Alex asks for Winn to be released into her custody until they can find proof that Winn is innocent. At the D.E.O., they discover similar art theft cases and prepare to go look for Lyra, starting at Al's Dive Bar. Alex tells Kara to stay behind because she can tell that Kara is upset with Mon-El. Rhea then transports into the headquarters and asks to speak to Kara.

                                              Rhea thanks Kara for looking after her son and to convince her to help get Mon-El to return to Daxam to lead their people. Rhea asks her to encourage Mon-El to speak to his parents.
                                              
                                              At the trailer park, Winn confronts Lyra, who insists that she was conning him the whole time. Winn and Guardian attempt to arrest her, but two goons armed with laser guns attack them. Alex also arrives and helps Guardian fend off the goons while Winn goes after Lyra. They capture Lyra and the painting as the two get away. Winn goes to Lyra's cell. She tells him that the gang she's working for has her brother Bastian. She tells him of the war on Starhaven and that she and her brother were smuggled to Earth for safety. Bastian fell in with a gang but accrued a debt. Lyra agreed to steal Starry Night to pay off his debt and that if the painting wasn't delivered to Mandrax by tonight, that they would kill Bastian. J'onn prepares the D.E.O. to go after Mandrax and his gang but tells Winn that Lyra is still conning him. Winn, stilling believing in Lyra, frees her and they go after her brother.

                                              Lyra and Winn meet up with Mandrax and his gang to give him the painting. Before they release Bastian, Mandrax discovers that the painting they gave him was a fake. He moves to kill them but Guardian jumps in front of him and punches him to no effect. They run, but Winn and Lyra are captured by the gangsters. Winn grabs one of their guns and points it at them in a standoff. Guardian continues to fend off Mandrax but is overpowered. Mandrax moves in for the kill, but the D.E.O. arrive and arrest everyone. Lyra is surprised by Winn's plan and then reunites with her brother.

Winn says bye to Lyra and kisses her. Kara asks him why he still cares about her after she lied to him. Winn says that Lyra never meant to hurt him.
                                              
                                              Kara arrives to her apartment, with Mon-El already being there. Mon-El admits to being the prince but that Kara had inspired him to be a hero. He says that he loves being with her, but Kara claims he only likes taking the easy route. She breaks up with him and shows him out the door.

Cisco is worried, as Barry hasn't really moved from the couch ever since his broken engagement with Iris. H.R. calls them, and they head to S.T.A.R. Labs. A breach has opened, and Mon-El and J'onn J'onzz from Earth-38 arrive with comatose Supergirl.

                                                Mon-El and J'onn explain, what happened to her, but they have no idea what is really going on. J'onn also mentions Music Meister came here to find Barry, since he intended to catch the fastest man alive. Cisco starts tracking the Music Meister, who did this to Kara, only to find he is in the speed lab. Barry goes to fight him, and H.R. encourages Wally to go as well. Music Meister mocks Wally, and knocks him out easily, as he is still shaken about his experience in the Speed Force. Barry attempts to attack the Meister, but he beats Barry to the ground, and hypnotizes him the same way he did with Kara.
                                                
                                                Barry finds himself in a 1940's nightclub and sees Kara singing "Moon River" on the stage, and is amazed how well Kara can sing. Kara manages to notice Barry, and after the song, the two meet in order to find out, what is going on. They encounter to the club owner, who looks exactly like Malcolm Merlyn (with Kara not knowing who he is), but he claims his name is Cutter Moran. and he threatens them to sing something original. Next, they encounter who appears to be Winn Schott, but his name is Grady. And finally they encounter a guy, who is like Cisco. Then Music Meister appears, and explains them, that it wasn't really him, who put them inside this illusion. He just triggered it, and mentions it turned out to be a musical, as both Barry and Kara love musicals (though it could've been anything). Music Meister says, that in order to get out, they need to follow the script to the end. He starts with the three men perform "Put a Little Love in Your Heart". After the song, he mentions that if they die here, they die also in the real world. With not much of a choice, Barry and Kara agree to do, what Music Meister said. Then, they are both knocked out by gangsters led by who seems to be Martin Stein.
                                                
                                                In the S.T.A.R. Labs, Caitlin finds, that Barry is losing his Speed Force, while Kara is losing the solar radiation inside her, and concludes Music Meister is stealing their powers. Cisco tracks him breaking into a bank with Kara's heat vision, and Wally and Cisco decide to go get him. J'onn offers to come too. Cisco disagrees, until J'onn reveals his Martian Manhunter form, and stuns everyone. The three go after Music Meister, and he has indeed Barry's speed. Wally gives chase, but as soon as he catches him, he uses Kara's flying power to escape. Cisco tells J'onn to jump into breach, in order to hit him. He does so, and Wally uses supersonic punch to knock him out cold.
                                                
                                                Inside the illusion, Kara and Barry are kept prisoners by Digsy Foss, who looks like Joe. He asks the heroes to find his daughter, Millie, who looks like Iris. They agree, and Cisco's look alike leads them to where she is. Kara reminds Barry, that even if she looks like Iris, it's not her. She also mentions she is glad she hasn't seen anyone, who looks like Mon-El. When they hear screams, they break down the door, and Kara is shocked, that Millie is making out with Tommy Moran, who looks exactly like Mon-El. The two lovers explain, that they are truly in love, but it is forbidden as they are the children of two rival gangster leaders. Barry says, that they should hold on to the love they have, and encourage them to tell it to their fathers. Barry takes Millie to Digsy, and Kara takes Tommy to Cutter. Both fathers are initially hostile towards it, until Barry and Kara explain the truth of their love. At the same time, both heroes come to understand their mutual feelings towards Iris and Mon-El. Fathers start to sing "More I Cannot Wish You", seemingly accepting their children's love. But as soon as Barry, Kara, Millie and Tommy leave, both fathers declare war on one another.

He claims he can't as his powers don't work that way. They need to finish the script, but then he mentions, that love is the real key of getting them back. If Iris truly loves Barry and Mon-El loves Kara, they can get them back.
                                                
                                                In the illusion, Barry and Kara feel relieved, that they succeeded, until Grady comes to tell them that it's rehearsal time. Realizing they need to finish the musical, Kara then asks if Grady have something original. He starts to play piano, and Barry and Kara make up a song "Superfriend" (the lyrics are about the Flash and Supergirl and their lives). Their live performance receives standing ovation. Suddenly, they hear gunfire outside, as the two rival families have started fighting. Barry attempts to diffuse the fight, but without his powers, he is shot. Kara is shot as well, and the hits cause their physical bodies to go into convulsions.Caitlin can't do anything for them, but then Iris and Mon-El remember, what Music Meister said: their love can bring them back. Iris urges Cisco to vibe them inside the illusion. It works, and they arrive to see their loved ones dying. Barry and Iris confess their love to each other, and Mon-El apologizes to Kara how he lied to her, and Kara forgives him. They kiss, and all four are returned to the real world. Everyone are happy, and Music Meister enters with applause. He tells Cisco that the particle accelerator prison never really held him. Barry and Kara are baffled, why he did this to them, and he tells them he wanted to teach them a lesson in love, as both Barry and Kara were two persons with broken hearts. The lesson was to make them realize that despite the lies and other problems they have with the ones they love, they can be overcome. He then disappears.
                                                
                                                Kara, Mon-El and J'onn are preparing to leave, and both heroes are amazed, what good singers they are. Kara also warns Mon-El, that if he ever lies to her again, she will drop a mountain on him. Barry and Iris return home, and the place is still the same. Barry starts to sing "Runnin' Home to You" to Iris, and at the end proposes to her again, this time with the right reasons.</div>

                                                <div class="box">Kara awakes to find Mon-El cooking breakfast, which he intended to serve her in bed, ruining the surprise. A news report shows an alien wreaking havoc in a park and Supergirl flies to handle it alone (due to Mon-El's stuff being in DEO). Kara subdues the alien.

                                                  In the DEO, J'onn is having a video conference with President Marsdin. She orders J'onn not engage the Daxamite ship under any circumstances, in order to avoid conflict with them. Alex and Maggie are out while they ran to Maggie's ex-girlfriend Emily. Both ex's feel uncomfortable, but Alex suggests a dinner so they could catch up.
                                                  
                                                  During the debriefing about the subdued alien, it is learned that it was a bounty hunter, and his target was Supergirl. Someone had put a bounty on her head, and for her own safety, as well as innocents, J'onn orders Kara to lay low for 24 hours, until DEO knows more about who put up the bounty. Mon-El immediately suspects his parents put up the bounty, so he meets them in the Al's Dive Bar. However, they deny any involvement, but Mon-El is still suspicious. In a restaurant, Alex and Maggie are still waiting for Emily and conclude she's not coming, and Maggie says her relationship with her didn't end well.
                                                  
                                                  Kara gets frustrated for having to sit still, but James and Winn manage to keep her in check. Mon-El arrives and tells them he went to see his parents in order to learn if they put up the bounty on Supergirl, thinking that elimination of Supergirl would make Mon-El return to his parents. Outside the apartment, a telepathic alien takes control Mon-El and forces him to attack Kara. They end up in another roof and fight each other, while also apologizing. Winn learns a bounty hunter is nearby and James goes to assist Kara in his Guardian outfit, while Winn manages to arrest the alien, with a stapler.
                                                  
                                                  The alien is taken to DEO for interrogation, but he refuses to say anything. J'onn uses his own telepathic abilities and manages to break him. He reveals the bounty on Supergirl was put up by Queen Rhea of Daxam, confirming Mon-El's suspicions. While cleaning up the apartment Mon-El suggests he and Kara flee, but Kara refuses and decides to meet with Rhea in the Fortress of Solitude. Mon-El believes that people can't change, especially his parents. Kara and Mon-El attempt to convince her that Earth is where Mon-El is happy, since he has Kara and friends, who care about him. But Rhea, convinced that Kara has poisoned his son's mind, pulls out Kryptonite Sais and stabs Kara. After a short fight Mon-El gives in and decides to return to his parents, leaving Kara devastated. Mon-El demands that Rhea call off the bounty on Kara, which she does. It is also learned that Lar Gand didn't know that Rhea put up the bounty.
                                                  
                                                  Alex meets up with Emily and learns that Maggie had been cheating on her, which caused the end of their relationship. When Alex speaks about this with Maggie, she feels uncomfortable, but Alex is not upset with her, rather she wants Maggie to silence the ghosts of her past.
                                                  
                                                  Kara returns to DEO weakened by the Kryptonite, and begs J'onn to help her get Mon-El back. J'onn and Alex are reluctant, since J'onn is under orders by the President not to engage the Daxamites, but eventually they agree to help her. Mon-El talks with his father about the changes he intends to do when he becomes king, and tries to make his father to understand. Rhea catches them and orders Mon-El to be locked up.
                                                  
                                                  Winn comes up with a plan to get to the Daxamite ship. By using the Maaldorian portal, they can teleport instantly into the ship, provided the have the right coordinates. Supergirl teleports into the ship and engages Daxamite guards. After subduing them, Rhea takes the Kryptonite Sais and attempts to stab Supergirl, but it has no effect, since this "Supergirl" was actually J'onn. Winn teleports to the prison deck and frees Mon-El and Kara goes to J'onn's aid. During the fight Lar Gand says that all they wanted was to have their family back, with J'onn countering they want their family back too, referring to Mon-El. Mon-El arrives to see Rhea harming Kara with Kryptonite and uses a guard staff to break the ship window. After the blast shield is brought in to close it, Lar Gand orders the fight to stop. Having realized that his son has made his choice about staying on Earth, he lets him go. Mon-El says that while he is glad that his parents are alive, this will be the last time they will see him, before leaving the ship with others.
                                                  
                                                  Back on Earth, Alex watches as Maggie and Emily make up, and Maggie thanks Alex. President Marsdin is displeased about J'onn that he assaulted the Daxamite ship, but J'onn is willing to take the responsibility and consequences. Kara and Mon-El discuss his parents and points out that Kara was right about that people can change, since his father changed and allowed him to stay on Earth. As the Daxamites leave Earth, Lar Gand tells disappointed Rhea that Daxamites aim for happiness, and realized that Mon-El wouldn't have been happy with them. As he hugs Rhea, she stabs him and proclaims he betrayed her, and declares she's not done with Earth.</div>

                                                  <div class="box">Kara flies happily above National City and, exited, lands at the D.E.O. for a day of butt-kicking, only to be disappointed that there's nothing going on. J'onn, Alex and Winn have other things to do, which leaves Kara with essentially nothing to do. She returns home and attempts to bake, only to fail every time. Lena suddenly shows up and asks her to come along with her to a demonstration arranged by her ex-boyfriend Jack Spheer, CEO of Spheerical Industries. Kara agrees and in the demonstration Kara encounters her ex-boss Snapper Carr. The demonstration is about a nanobots capable of curing any kind of wound or ailment, called Biomax. This encourages Kara to make use of her reporter skills again, and she manages to beat Snapper by getting her question to Jack answered. Later, as Jack attempts to reconcile with Lena, Kara meets with a man named Joe Watkins, who tells her to meet with him later that evening. Kara shows up and inside his car Joe reveals that even though Spheerical delivered human trial tests, he believes Spheerical faked them. However, neither Kara or Joe witness that a swarm of Biomax nanobots is crawling under the car. By the time they hear the noise they make, the car explodes. Thanks to her powers, Kara survives but Joe is killed.

                                                    The next day Kara shows up at CatCo and asks James to publish a scoop about Spheerical under his name, as Kara is unable to use CatCo's resources. Snapper is also on the case. As Kara leaves, she uses her super-hearing and learns that Snapper has a source of his own called Derrick Simmons, who took part in Spheerical's human trials. At L-Corp, Jack attempts to get back together with Lena, but Lena is unsure.
                                                    
                                                    The following evening, Kara, as Supergirl, arrives Derrick's place and with her X-ray vision, sees Snapper arrive too. Derrick reveals, that he took part on the Spheerical's human trials, but that he only filled a form; nothing was done to him. The Biomax nanoswarm then appears and they kill Derrick, leaving nothing out of him. Supergirl enters and saves Snapper by freezing the nanoswarm.
                                                    
                                                    Kara returns home, disappointed that she has nothing on how to stop the nanoswarm and that two people are killed. Mon-El stops her by saying that Lena could be of help (as she had been trying to reach Kara), which then urges Kara to go see her, and she tells Mon-El to come along. At a restaurant, Kara and Mon-El find Lena with Jack. Kara introduces Mon-El as Mike, and then questions Jack about the nanobots, which also sparks Lena's curiosity. Jack explains how he was able to figure out the code on controlling the nanobots by thinking Lena (which inspired him to get back together with her). As Kara and Mon-El leaves, he hugs Jack in order to swipe his keycard, so Kara and he can snoop Jack's personal computer in Spheerical.
                                                    
                                                    Kara and Mon-El break in to Spheerical offices and access Jack's computer. As they search the "Human Trials"-folder, it's empty. Mon-El opens another folder that has a video file. As they play it, it shows that Jack injected the Biomax nanobots into himself, turning him into a nanoswarm cyborg. This proves that Spheerical never performed any human trials, and that's why Joe and Derrick were killed. Kara and Mon-El copy the video. At the same time Lena and Jack kiss, and Jack then leaves and returns to his office as a nanoswarm. Kara and Mon-El escape just in time.
                                                    
                                                    The next day Kara visits Lena and tells him that Jack killed two people and controls the Biomax nanobots. Lena doesn't believe it until Kara shows her the video. Lena wants to meet with him, but Kara urges her to stay away from him, and she agrees. Kara goes to CatCo and delivers her findings to Snapper. Agreeing to look into the matter together, Snapper and Kara combine their findings and their information aligns that Spheerical faked the human trials. Snapper had also found an indication, which points to Beth Green, Spheerical's financial director. Kara goes to investigate.
                                                    
                                                    Against Kara's advice, Lena goes to see Jack. As Lena accuses Jack, Jack claims he doesn't know what she is talking about. This is proven to be true, when Beth arrives and admits that she controls Biomax. It has made Jack compliant as the nanobots inhibit his free will. Lena tries to reach out to Jack to no avail, until Supergirl arrives. She engages Jack while Lena and Beth fight.

                                                    "Did I tell you I'm a Luthor?"
                                                    —Beth Breen vs. Lena Luthor
                                                    Lena manages to beat Beth, but Biomax pins Supergirl to a structure and overwhlems her. Lena destroys Beth's control device, which frees Jack from her control. Jack urges Lena to use system override from the mainframe, but Beth says if she does that, Jack will die. Overwhelmed with emotion, Lena initiates system override, which disables the nanobots and kills Jack.Beth is arrested and Lena grieves over Jack.
                                                    
                                                    The next day Kara comes to comfort Lena about Jack's death and promises her that she will never leave her. Kara then goes to CatCo and just as Snapper calls out to Eve about her snack, Kara arrives with her own take on it. Snapper then shows Kara the article about Spheerical, and asks Kara to look at the headline; the article is published with both Snapper's and Kara's names. Kara then admits that Snapper taught her, that in the end it's not the reporter that matters, but the truth. And she has been seeking truth so badly, that she overstepped her authority and broke the rules. Snapper then tells Kara that he is impressed about how Kara kept searching for the truth despite her source getting killed in front her eyes, and that they need more reporters like her, thus giving Kara her job back.

The stalemate closes with Supergirl flying into the structure and evacuating a couple of hoodlums. Maggie is a little angry that she wasn't permitted to carry out her responsibility, yet Supergirl was simply attempting to be useful. She takes off to get pizza with Mon-El.

                                                      Over supper, Alex and Maggie banter with Mon-El and Kara whether it's their business to step in when the police are making some hard memories. Maggie gripes that there are "Supergirl safeguard" cases in the courts where speculates guarantee that extreme power and tainted proof ought to excuse them,. She says Supergirl should adhere to outsiders and worldwide dangers.

She ventures into a lift with a man whose face is clouded by a cap, and the entryways close.

Rhea is pretty clearly going about like she's only a standard businessperson and not uncovering her outsider nature or the way that she has a mean-on for Supergirl.

Kara's telephone rings, yet it's a man's voice, saying that he knows she's more than she lets on. He reveals to her that he has Alex, and sends her a photograph of Alex tied up. He says he needs her to break a man named Peter Thompson out of jail or probably Alex will bite the dust, and that he realizes she can because he knows she's Supergirl.

She discloses to Lena that her child was consistently the adoration for her life until he met "this repulsive young lady, and everything transformed." She says that she and her better half lost their child, and closely following it, her significant other passed on. She gives Lena a USB drive with the staying key ideas that she recently retained from the structure she was proposing. They give an impromptu speech, and when Rhea says "thank the divine beings I discovered you," Lena appears to be genuinely dubious.

J'onn guesses what him might be thinking and reveals to Kara that they're done here. After Thompson leaves, Kara gets a call from Winn, who says Thompson has an ill-conceived child - somebody who experienced childhood in Kara's old neighborhood of Midvale.

She's drawn nearer by Rick Malverne, the man who's holding Alex prisoner, and he won't surrender Alex, yet allows the pair to pair. He discloses to Kara that there's no moving on the arrangement: his dad for Alex. She compromises him with heat vision, yet he says that in the event that she harms him, she'll never discover Alex and she will bite the dust gradually.
                                                      
                                                      Supergirl has taken Thompson in to jail - he saw Kara Danvers accomplish something unimaginable - salvage an infant from a consuming vehicle when she was a high schooler - and later made sense of she was Supergirl. He had a damaging mother, and had an awful connection with her, however his father got him away from her and has upheld him for a considerable length of time. He's doing this to spare his father like his father spared him. Kara blows up and tosses him around a bit, and when Maggie reveals to her they're done here. Outside, she discloses to Kara that she understood in there that Thompson is clearly the way to getting Alex back.

                                                          Alex reveals to Supergirl that she's proceeding with the president's arrangement, despite the fact that Supergirl says its wrong. Supergirl storms outside and stops for a moment to chat with Cat Grant. Supergirl says that her closest companion and sweetheart are both caught in the boat and that her life would be crushed in the event that they annihilated that transport. Supergirl says she's simply being childish, however Cat says that she's simply being human. Cat Grant reveals to Supergirl that she was disturbed in National City and inevitably found that it's not about what you do, it's about who you love. Cat’s discourse rouses Supergirl to make a move and spare her companions. Furthermore, Supergirl's initial step is to discover Lillian Luthor.
                                                          
                                                          Supergirl takes Lillian back to the bar with Hank Henshaw. Lillian will likely utilize Superman's Phantom Zone projector to ship Henshaw to the Daxamite cruiser, where he would then be able to bring every other person on board. When Supergirl spares Lena and Mon-El, Alex would then be able to explode the boat. Cat volunteers (with Winn) to make an interruption. Before they leave, Winn plants something on Henshaw, apparently to keep him in line.
                                                          
                                                          Supergirl, Henshaw, and Lillian effectively enter the Phantom Zone, as Rhea manages Lena and Mon-El's wedding function. In the interim, Cat returns to her office (appalled at what James has never really spot) and sets up a communicate.
                                                          
                                                          Supergirl's group teleports into the Daxamite shipand begin battling their way through the boat. Directly before Rhea completes the service, Cat's communicated interferes with them. She encourages National City to "oppose," and persuades the city to precipitously begin retaliating once more.
                                                          
                                                          Henshaw effectively hacks into the Daxamite framework. He discovers Lena, similarly as Lena and Mon-El stage their own breakout endeavor. In the mean time, Alex prepares the gun to shoot similarly as Supergirl discovers Mon-El and Lena on the ship. Lillian snatches Lena and teleports away, leaving Supergirl and Mon-El behind. Lillian then calls Alex and advises her to fire the gun. Alex, believing that Supergirl is with Lillian, energizes the huge weapon.
                                                          
                                                          Lena discloses to her mom to walk out on, however Supergirl is out in front of her. Turns out that Winn bothered Henshaw so that Supergirl could remote control him. Supergirl advises Mon-El that he needs to teleport away, yet that she's going to remain behind and allow his mom to give up smoothly.
                                                          
                                                          Daxamite fighters teleport into CatCo to target Cat, however Guardian appears and knocks them out. After Guardian deals with the Daxamites, Cat expresses gratitude toward him and uncovers that she knows James Olsen is behind the head protector.
                                                          
                                                          Mon-El teleports into the Fortress of Solitude and connects with Alex. He attempts to wave Alex off, yet the president orders Alex to shoot the Daxamite cruiser down.
                                                          
                                                          Supergirl attempts to get Rhea to give up, however she's absolutely unaffected. Rhea uncovers that she has another stunt at her disposal, as a heat vision impact impacts the DEO's cannon. Supergirl pivots and gets punched in the face by Rhea's distinct advantage: the Man of Steel himself, Superman.</div>

                                                          <div class="box">Supergirl is forced to battle Superman, as Rhea has infected him with Silver Kryptonite. It causes Superman to hallucinate Supergirl as his greatest enemy, General Zod. The fight between the two Kryptonians ends up into a fountain in the city, in which Supergirl is eventually able to defeat Superman, although exhausting herself. Kara then finds herself in her bed with Mon-El, and they discuss their happy life, until Mon-El tells her to wake up, as this is not real. Kara wakes up to find herself inside Fortress of Solitude, with Alex watching over her and Clark. Alex explains that after the fight Kara took her and Clark and with the last of her strength flew them to the Fortress to recuperate. Clark awakes and is back to normal, though he is perplexed about the Silver Kryptonite. Clark then access the Fortress computer to find out some way to defeat the Daxamite invasion (while also telling Kara she owes him a new robot). They find something.

                                                            Kara, Clark and Alex return to the DEO, where Mon-El is relieved to see Kara all right and officially meets Superman for the first time. Clark and Kara explain that they have discovered the rite of Dakkam Ur, a trial by combat, which has been used in the wars between Krypton and Daxam. In Dakkam Ur, champions of both factions fight one-on-one, and the defeated will have to honor the victor by doing what the victor demands. Mon-El immediately says it's a bad idea, but Kara nonetheless is going to challenge Queen Rhea to it. Kara uses DEOs communication array to declare her challenge to Rhea throughout the city. Kara demands that if she wins, Rhea will pull the Daxamite fleet from Earth and leave, and if Rhea wins, Earth is hers. Rhea accepts the challenge. Mon-El tries to suggest that Clark fight instead, but Clark tells him that Kara officially defeated him, thus making her the champion of Earth.
                                                            
                                                            Kara and Clark go to CatCo to speak with Cat Grant, so that she would make sure that no civilians are nearby during the trial. Next, they get a call from Lena, and meet with her at L-Corp as well as Lillian. They have come up with a contingency plan: should Kara fail to defeat Rhea, they will use Lex's atmospherical bomb to line the Earth's atmosphere with lead, just that it will be harmless to humans but toxic to Daxamites. Kara assures it won't come to that. Lena requests that Winn help her with the bomb.
                                                            
                                                            Kara and Clark return to DEO and inform everyone of Lena's and Lillian's plan. Winn wonders will the bomb also kill Mon-El. Clark says that he should be able to survive a little longer since he has been exposed to Earth's yellow sun for months, but it would mean that he has to leave Earth. Clark asks Kara what he can do to help. Kara says he can help her train. The two cousins train intensively. Kara then wonders if she can truly defeat Rhea. Clark tells her that every time he fights, he always fights for Lois, inspiring Kara to fight for something she loves.
                                                            
                                                            Kara heads to the battle site with Mon-El as moral support, where Rhea is already waiting. Mon-El encourages Kara to fight to the last. The fight goes according to rules until Rhea dishonors herself by ordering the Daxamite fleet to attack. Mon-El immediately denounces her mother for dishonoring the gods and that she killed Lar Gand, but Rhea claims that gods are only interested in her victory. Kara urges Mon-El to go and fight the Daxamites. Clark, J'onn, Maggie and the DEO also join the fight in the streets. Meanwhile, at L-Corp, Lena and Winn manage to get the bomb working. Lillian immediately attempts to detonate it, but Lena and Winn, having anticipated that, reveal that they gave the real detonator to Kara, so that only Supergirl has the means to detonate it.
                                                            
                                                            As Mon-El, Clark and J'onn fight the Daxamites, they get unexpected help from M'gann M'orzz and her group of reformed White Martians. Daxamites declare Mon-El a traitor, but he manages to defeat them and Clark manages to take out a number of Daxamite ships. Meanwhile. Rhea starts to truly play dirty when she reveals that she has coated her body with Kryptonite, giving her a dishonorable advantage over Kara. Kara finds herself fighting a losing battle as Rhea declares that after she has taken care of National City, she will move to Star City and beyond. This causes Kara to find a strength of will that allows her fight Rhea on equal terms despite her advantage. Mon-El then arrives and Rhea then plays her last trump card: she orders her fleet to target every major civilian target in city: hospitals, schools etc. Kara, Clark, J'onn and Alex all realize they don't have the means to stop the fleet in time. Kara takes the lead bomb detonator, but is unable to use it. Mon-El holds Kara and without saying anything urges her to use it. Kara apologizes to him and presses the detonator. The bomb goes off and the atmosphere is lined with lead particles. All Daxamites immediately start to feel the effects. Ground soldiers die and fleet begins to retreat. Rhea finds herself unable to breathe and collapses and begs Mon-El to save her, but he refuses as she killed his father. Rhea dissolves into dust and Mon-El starts to have symptoms
                                                            
                                                            Kara calls Alex what she can do, but Alex says Mon-El only has minutes until the lead-lined atmosphere kills him. Overwhelmed with grief, Kara flies Mon-El to his pod and openly cries as Mon-El is forced to leave Earth. As much as Kara doesn't want him to leave, she has no choice. Kara declares she loves him and Mon-El says the same. Before Mon-El boards the pod, Kara gives him her mother's necklace to always remember her. Mon-El boards the pod and leaves.
                                                            
                                                            The following night Kara watches the night sky as Clark comes to tell her that he probably wouldn't have been able to detonate the bomb, thus claiming that she is stronger than him. He then returns to Metropolis and Kara tells him to say Lois hi for her. Alex comes to talk with her and Kara urges Alex to hold on to things she loves, which inspires Alex to propose to Maggie.
                                                            
                                                            The next day at CatCo, Kara is having an emotional day and when Cat asks her what's wrong, Kara tells her that while Cat was away, she was having a wonderful relationship, but it didn't work out in the end. Cat encourages Kara by giving her advice about women's strength and also tells her that she was rather impressed about all the articles she wrote during that year. A report of an armed robbery is called and Kara leaves, and it is revealed that Cat knows Kara is Supergirl. As Kara flies above the city, she is grieving over Mon-El. In outer space, Mon-El looks at Kara's necklace, when a wormhole suddenly opens in front of him. He has no means of avoiding it and disappears into it.
                                                            
                                                            35 years earlier, on Krypton, Kal-El and Kara are sent to Earth. Elsewhere on Krypton, a mysterious group puts another Kryptonian child into a pod and send it to the same destination. They say that once the child awakens, it will grow strong on Earth and "reign".</div>
