Deciding this doesn't sit well with him, James goes to visit his old mentor, Nelson Stewart, at the newspaper he started working at. Nelson, like Simon, confirms that keeping people in prison longer than they should be lines the pockets of those in charge, which keeps Calvintown alive. After getting on the phone with a lawyer from National City, James promises to get Simon's mom out of prison and agrees to cover the cost. But when Simon finds out James isn't staying in town, he gets upset and runs away. James and Kelly soon return to National City to help Supergirl.

                In CatCo the next day, Nia shares with Kara that her friend was able to decrypt the address linked to the account, and that it is located in National City. Kara goes to the address as Supergirl and discovers a "murder board" of sorts, with the center picture being one of Andrea Rojas. William enters the room, and Kara quickly switches outfits. William urges Kara to leave, but Kara demands to know what's going on. William reveals that he is undercover to investigate Andrea. Kara asks for the truth, and William reveals that he helped Elena fake her death because she thought "they" were onto her and that he needed to keep her safe, and that Sergio Ramos is actually a member of Interpol, and is just undercover in Intergang, and that he helped get Elena out. He is staying silent about the Rojases because he has no proof that directly connects them to a criminal conspiracy he claims is bigger than Al Capone; he took the job at CatCo to get closer to Andrea and get into her inner circle. He states that how he acted at CatCo was simply an act, and he thinks that Kara's writing is actually really good. Kara, however, states that she doesn't know if she can forgive William, which he understands.
                
                It is ultimately revealed that when Malefic was hit with the Phantom Zone projector, instead of being sent to the Phantom Zone, he was instead sent to Lena's laboratory. While he is trapped there, Lena says that they can help one another.</div>

After a quick meeting with her staff, she dismisses everyone, while Nia tells Kara how disappointed she is, that Kara was unable to find a connection between Andrea and William who was once again sucking up to the boss.

Alex meets her outside and reminds her that was not Brainiac. Kara takes it upon herself to break into her boss’ office to look for clues but is almost immediately stopped when William arrives to do the exact same thing. William is unable to crack her computer, that Kara is able to find a secret hidden box. Inside is a photo of Andrea and Russell Rogers along with some jewelry and some other objects. Will admits the reason he has been so obsessed with uncovering the Rojas Family, is because two years ago his best friend was dating Andrea. The day before they met, his house was broken into and he never saw Russell Rogers again. Kara tried to console him, but is called away by Alex to New Mexico. After a brief physical confrontation with Rip Roar he stopped her with a Fusion Cannon. Supergirl radios J'onn and he flies her back to the DEO under solar lamps.

After some persuasion, he agrees, provided Lena agrees to help him take out his brother. By the end of the day, Malefic has completed his tasks and turned the Maladorian Dendroasp completely harmless. However, when Lena declines to kill anyone for him he threatens to become violent, however, she stops him by using his Q-Waves against him.

                  Once Supergirl is feeling better, Supergirl is determined to stop whatever it is coming their way. Unfortunately, they are greeted with more bad news, as Brainiac explains the geyser is pumping out three cubic miles of water every second. At that rate, every coastal city in the world will start flooding in 12 minutes. The loss of life could be in the billions. Supergirl and J'onn immediately go to Lake Vostok in Antarctica where they fight Rip Roar and are finally able to beat him together. After they must seal the geyser and agree to fly around it together in perfect sync before Supergirl is able to freeze it with her breath. Successful they both head back to the DEO.

                          Lena Luthor is looking outside L-Corp, astonished at the quantum tower now in the city. Alex invites herself into her private office in full DEO uniform. Lena is unthreatened and asked Alex if she has come to accuse her of more crimes and arrest her. Alex takes the bait, and asked Lena what she expects after stealing Myriad, and almost killing Supergirl, just last week. Lena immediately denies the claim, insisting it was Eve Teschmacher, and she has already been arrested. Alex knows she is lying, but this is not the time to argue. Alex brings up how they are all in danger and Lena needs to put her feelings aside to help save the world again. Lena obviously agrees but is upset that the Danvers sisters would think she might not help, considering, once again, that it is she who is the good guy. Inside the tower, the six heroes are deciding how to handle the situation and determined to keep it safe. GA and Mia arrived, with Mia in her new suit. Arrow instructs Supergirl and Superman to protect the outside, while they run inside, all while the Earth is continuously moved by more and more powerful earthquakes. When inside Arrow casually tells his daughter that no matter what happens to him, it is her job to find her mother. They are soon attacked by an army of flying spirits. Everyone is surprised at such an out-worldly attack. In the chaos, Batwoman agrees to an upgrade from The Atom. While talking to himself he is able to magnetize one of her throwing bats in order for it to come back to her. In the chaos, Mia is even able to send an arrow past her father destroying an unseen enemy behind him. Oliver nods his thanks to his daughter, proud of who she is becoming. Superman, Supergirl and Flash arrived to help, they are quickly able to take care of the situation and destroy all of the spirits that are within the tower.</div>

                          <div class="box">White Canary, Lois, and Brainiac are all surprised to tract baby Jonathan's signature to Earth-16 Arrowcave. Brainiac is rather surprised, but Sara insists he probably found a helpless baby and decided to take it away from the chaos raging outside. Brainiac is immediately hit with a trick arrow that wraps around him, making him fall over. Oliver Queen appears as Green Arrow and immediately begins fighting White Canary. The two continuously go back and forth while Lois tries to help Brainy, but is quickly distracted when she hears her baby cry. Sara is able to stop him knowing about his bad arm having previously met this Oliver before. He is shocked and astonished to see her, scurrying how it is possible she is standing before him. He wants to know how she got off the Gambit, and Sara generally asks him if he doesn't remember meeting her on the island. He seems to have not. Oliver immediately begins to apologize to her, he didn't mean to get her killed, having regretted ruining her life. Sarah immediately chimes in, telling him that going with him on the boat was her decision and hers alone. And that what happened to them after changed both their lives for the better, and now she is a time traveler and having a time of her life. Lois walks in behind them holding a crying Jonathan, and thanks Oliver for finding her child. Oliver and Sara continue to have a tender moment, and Sara insists her life ended up for the better. They are interrupted by Brainy, insisting they have to go now. Before leaving Sara tells Oliver “You're a good man, on every Earth.” all three of them head into the dimensional portal and vanish.</div>

                          <div class="box">Outside of National City, Dreamer and Kelly are trying to help coordinate people onto spaceships while trying to keep them calm among the chaos. They are extremely surprised and happy when J'onn arrives with the Legion ship, the ship is capable of putting hundreds of thousands of people aboard.

                            Inside the DEO Lena and Alex are still trying to figure out how to transport the ships away/to fly off Earth, as even space is no longer a viable option; it itself is being erased. Instead, it is suggested to connect a breach to the portal to evacuate the population to Earth-1: Lena isn't sure how to stop people on the ships from evaporating once she transports them to another Earth. Alex suggests 'Galleon's Theory' of “using an inverse variable to help calculate the differential?” Lena agrees it is a good idea. Excited to have cracked the puzzle they are able to send the spaceships away to another Earth. Before leaving Lena reminds Alex, that regardless they are still not friends. Outside she helps coordinate people to safety. Kelly Olsen even saves a woman using James' Shield from when he was Guardian. While outside the tower, the six heroes are again left disappointed when the tower breaks. Oliver tells Superman and Supergirl to see what they can do and they both fly up, Superman realizes the tower is powered by what looks like solar panels and immediately begins blasting it with his heat vision, Supergirl follows suit. They continue to blast at the solar panel for as long as they can, Superman is the first to fall, followed soon by Supergirl. Luckily it was enough to power up the tower again. The red skies dissipate but they are still faced with flying angry spirits, and they now have only 14 minutes until the tower shuts down again. Everyone begins fighting them full throttle but The Monitor appears insisting they save their strength, this world is already doomed and he begins vanishing in them away one by one. First Batwoman, followed by Superman, Supergirl, he also takes the Flash, Ray, and Mia. Only Green Arrow is left. Before he can take him, Oliver demands to know how many people are left, and The Monitor admits there are still many that won't be saved. Oliver refuses to leave and shoots The Monitor with an antimatter arrow, disrupting his powers. Oliver is struck by one of the flying spirits and loses his footing, only to realize he is out of arrows. Not wanting to give up, Oliver takes a stand and decides to continue to fight with his bare hands, even if it is in vain, wanting to save as many people as he can. As ships leave for the transmatter portal, the antimatter wave overwhelms and destroys National City and Earth-38.</div>

                            <div class="box">Oliver appears in his lair, extremely bloody and bruised, on the verge of dying. He is immediately surrounded by The Flash, Supergirl and his daughter Mia. There, The Monitor tells the room, Earth-38 did not survive, but because of Oliver Queen's noble sacrifice, he was able to personally ensure the lives of another billion people. Kara is both devastated at the news of the loss of her planet, along with the reality of her friend Green Arrow's pending demise. They are surprised when Pariah appears before them. He insists he is no longer Harrison "Nash" Wells, admitting he is simply a man serving his penance. He freed the Anti-Monitor from his confinement only to become a Pariah and sentenced to bear witness to his actions. At this time, Lois, Sara, and Brainy all return to Earth-1. Superman goes to greet his wife, happy his child is safe, wanting to give the man and his family some space. Oliver confides that he gave it all up sacrificing his life for Barry and Kara. Both are immediately surprised and heartbroken to hear this devastating news. Oliver calls his daughter closer and tells her to promise she will find her mother and to tell William he loves him, teary-eyed she confirms she will. Oliver dies seconds after this

                              The Monitor admits Oliver was to die, but it wasn't supposed to be like this. Pariah informs them that because of this, things are different and they are changing quickly, and that they are all most likely doomed.</div>

Kara then asks if they aren't going to wait for Barry, but Kate replies that she doesn't think he's ready to say goodbye to his friend just yet. Kara refuses to drink, saying that it feels like giving up, and believes that there's a way to undo the Crisis. Sara suggests that they prevent it from happening to every other universe. Harbinger arrives and says that Diggle is with JJ and doesn't know about Oliver dying just yet. She realizes how messed up that is and tells Sara, that she's just trying to find a way to break it to him.

                                Then Ray is heard saying to the Monitor that he can't hijack the Waverider, because their crew is still there. The Monitor says how if there's any chance of them all surviving the crisis, they need its technology. Sarah however, mentions that she kinda promised their crew that they wouldn't have to do another crossover. Harbinger replies that they don't need Sara's crew; just Ray's lab, and they have an entire multiverse of Waveriders at their disposal and teleports away to the Waverider.</div>

Mick Rory steps out wielding his Heat gun and Cold gun, and explains that he took this Waverider because no one was using it. Harbinger, for her part, thought that The Legends on Earth-74 had all either retired or died. The Leonard A.I. explains that Mick is trying to become a romance writer, and Harbinger invites Mick to come with her for the beer, stories, and the chance to save the Multiverse.</div>

                                <div class="box">When the Waverider arrives on Earth-1, the Monitor says that they've suffered a horrible loss. However, there are seven heroes of the purest will. Clark and Kara try to comfort Jonathan, but the baby doesn't settle down until Mick takes him. The Monitor says that the seven heroes are Paragons, and he only learned of them by consulting the Book of Destiny. When Kate asked The Monitor where he got these names and pseudonyms, he answers that he enlisted the help of Felicity Smoak. Who earned the wisdom from a second book. He summons the aforementioned Book and explains that he went into the time-stream and retrieved the book. As Mia arrives, Kara asks if the Book can bring back the destroyed Earths. The Monitor warns that it would cause madness, and Mia asks if the Book can bring Oliver back. Mar Novu says that it's impossible and that he grows weaker as the Anti-Monitor grows stronger. The Monitor tells them that Kara is the Paragon of Hope. Sara is the Paragon of Destiny, and one of the others is a Kryptonian who is the Paragon of Truth. Clark and Lois offer to find him, and the Monitor says that the fourth Paragon is of Courage and is known only as the "Bat of the Future". The Tome of the Guardians revealed Kara and Sara's names to him and the descriptions for the other two. They also all collectively find out that Bruce Wayne is the Dark Knight, with Kate asking if they could all keep that to themselves. Kate then asks the others who wanted to meet Batman.

                                  Bruce Wayne exists in the future on Earth-99, where he has dedicated himself body and soul to fighting crime. Later, Kara looks at a display of Earth-38 being destroyed, and Lex comes in with the Monitor. Lex is amused at the destruction of his homeworld, and the Monitor tells Kara that even Lex has an important part to play in this crisis. So he resurrected him after he'd been killed. As Kate comes in, the Monitor explains that he had the power to bring Lex back before the Crisis began. Kara refuses to work with Lex as an ally, and Kate meets Lex and introduces herself as new & unfriendly.
                                  
                                  Kate goes after Kara and they bond over their mutual losses. After a moment, Kate takes out an extrapolator and invites Kara to come with her and save the universe.

He teleports away with it, and the Monitor comes in. Harbinger warns him that Lex took the Book, and the Monitor says that they all have a part to play.

Iris says that the Monitor gave her a mission to find the Kryptonian Paragon, and they kiss as Iris says that she will take whatever time she has with Barry.

Mia says Nyssa told her everything she needs to know about the Pits and about Sara for that matter; making it clear she doesn't trust Sara.</div>

                                    When Kate says that the Bruce she knew wore a different kind of suit, he replies by saying that it's a product of a lifetime of injuries.

                                      Lois tells Clark Kent of Earth-167 about how their Earth's version of Lex Luthor is going to try and kill him. The trio disappeared, and Lex steps out with the Book and greets his "old friend". Clark says that Lex isn't the Lex he knows, and Lex explains that he sent the others back to Waverider. He insists that Clark will always be his greatest enemy on any Earth, and he knows that this Clark Kent is Superman. He finds it ironic, as Earth-38's version of Clark Kent is not the Man of Steel. Lex takes out a piece of Kryptonite, and Clark tosses it away and says that kryptonite hasn't affected him since he gave up his powers.

One of them was a Joker card with blood on them. Kara then sees a pair of broken glasses, and Earth-99 Luke says that those belonged to this Earth's Superman.

                                              <h3>Earth-203 - New Gotham</h3>
                                              <div class="box">In the cargo bay, Kara brings Kate a beer, telling her she looked like she needed a drinking buddy. Kate wonders how she, of all people, can be a Paragon. Kara points out that Kate has saved all of them, and says that how hard Kate tries is what makes her a hero. She assures her friend that she has heart and bravery, and Kate wonders if she'll end up like Bruce. Kara assures her that she'll make her own destiny, and gives Kate a photo from Bruce's library of Earth-99 Kate and Earth-99 Beth. Kate says she wishes that she knew her Beth like this, Kara then tells her that maybe she still can. After Kara has told Kate she plans to use the Book of Destiny to bring back Earth-38, Kate tells her that is really dangerous according to The Monitor. She says that she knows, but what good is being the Paragon of Hope if she doesn't have any. As Kara walks away, Kate holds onto the Kryptonite she took from the older Bruce from Earth-99 they visited earlier.

                                                Harbinger continues to hear the voice in her head and begs it to stop. She is then teleported away into what seems like a dark S.T.A.R. Labs hallway. A figure steps out of the shadows addresses Lyla by name and says that his strength grows stronger as Earths' die. He says that he is the Anti-Monitor, and tells Harbinger that there is work to be done.</div>
                                                <h3>Earth-1 - Waverider</h3>
                                                <div class="box">Inside the Waverider, seven people remain including both Supermen. Mar Novu reminds them they have only located four of the seven Paragons. Ray is off to the side, insisting what he is doing is a very difficult and time-consuming task. The room lights up with the arrival of the rest of Team Flash. Ray is excited to have Cisco join them, please to have someone he can talk out the math with. Ralph is very surprised to see a doppelgänger of Superman, while Frost tells everyone to ignore him, as he is new, and this is his first crossover. Novu interrupts, reminding everyone that the wave is moving rapidly, and Earth-1 will be the final world to be destroyed. Supergirl informs them that Alex and Brainy are still safe and everyone from Earth-38 is still present and accounted for, regardless of the continuing distractions of all the other universes. They decide to bring as many people as they can to Earth-1, trying to save whoever they can across the multiverse. J'onn tells everyone he can use his psychic abilities to keep everyone connected within the Waverider. Lois decides to return to the legion ship, because parallel Earth Rory still has baby Jonathan, and she will keep everyone updated from her end.

                                                  Everyone is interrupted with the excitement from Ray and Cisco, having finished working on finding out who the remaining Paragons are. Batwoman asks what's taking so long and Cisco tells her to wait as the machine is some buffering. It is revealed that The Flash is the "Paragon of Love", "J'onn J'onzz" is the "Paragon of Honor" and Dr. Ryan Choi is the "Paragon of Humanity". Which means the only person they don't have a location on is Dr. Ryan Choi. Luckily he is in Raymond's hometown at Ivy University. Ray, Ralph, and Iris all decide to go collect him. The Monitor confirms now that the final Paragons have been identified, they next must determine how to stop the antimatter wave. They are interrupted with Leonard announcing Diggle's arrival. In the infirmary, Dig is furious to find an unconscious and half dead Oliver. Sara tries to calm him, but Dig insists he should have been there to protect him. Sara reveals they are looking to bring him back, the same way Olly brought her back. Though he doesn't like it, Dig insists he is coming with them. The Monitor arrives and unceremoniously informs Dig that Harbinger is missing. Dig loses his temper and insists he is not losing his wife or his best friend. Both of them team up against The Monitor, and he admits the Harbinger could possibly be with his adversary, the Anti-Monitor.

                                                  The Monitor explains to the room, now in front of the rest of the heroes who their real enemy is. He informs them all that he has been preparing them and testing them to learn their limits for a long time now. He needed their courage and honor as well as their strength and everything else the Paragon stands for. Because he needed the greatest heroes, in order to defeat their greatest threat. The Anti-Monitor's goal is to eliminate the multiverse and replace it with his own design. Supergirl isn't surprised, insisting he is like every other megalomaniac. The Monitor admits he should have seen that his connection with the Harbinger could be used against him. Dig doesn't care and just wants to know how to get his wife back, their interests to find her falls on deaf ears. He cannot rewrite history, he can only attempt to save what remains. Supergirl is upset with the conversation and leaves to cool her head. Batwoman watches her go, taking out the Kryptonite Bruce Wayne gave her, and questioning if she will have to use it. Sara promises to watch over Oliver's body while Dig, takes Mia to find Ollie's soul.
                                                  
                                                  Frost and Cisco are both in the control room and Cisco is excited when he announces he is trying to determine where the antimatter Wave-Particle is on Earth, to locate the source of the waves and he has discovered its located at a subterranean region very close to them. Excited, he tells Frost to meet him in the cargo bay. On his way there he is startled to run into The Monitor, having just left him in the control room. Their The Monitor informs him it is time for him to become Vibe again. Against Cisco's protest, he immediately transforms him into Vibe, giving him his powers back.
                                                  
                                                  Flash and Iris are saying their goodbyes to each other, Iris is still worried of the prophecy about losing her husband in the Crisis. Iris asks him if he's sure he still wants her to go to Ivy Town, and Flash insists she must. They share a tender moment before Flash goes with Frost and Cisco.</div>
                                                  <h3>Earth-1 - Central City</h3>
                                                  <div class="box">Cisco is able to breach the three of them to the underground bunker; Barry immediately speeds off to run a perimeter search. Frost and Cisco make it to the end of the hallway and they are standing before a wall encrypted with a set of symbols. A total of seven hieroglyphics. Both of them are interrupted by the presence of Pariah he re-introduces himself to the group, insisting he is no longer Nash and has only arrived to bear witness to tragedy. Cisco is neither surprised or impressed with his new name and look. When pressed as to what happened to him, Pariah admits he was searching these tunnels for Mar Nova in order to kill him, expose him as a false god, only to be controlled by another god, the Anti-Monitor. He had laid the perfect track for him, manipulating him to gain a foothold into this universe. They ask Pariah if he remembers how to open the door, but he does not. Pariah then reminds Cisco he can now vibe Nash's old memories. It works and Cisco is able to unlock the door behind the hieroglyphics.</div>
                                                  <h3>Earth-1 - Waverider</h3>
                                                  <div class="box">Supergirl and Batwoman are in the holding cell with Lex Luthor who is entertained with their predicament. Supergirl questions on whether or not it's possible to bring back Earth-38, and he declines to give a clear answer. Batwoman has become annoyed with Lex and takes down the force shield holding the man, and slams him against the wall, demanding answers. Lex again makes a joke, but Batwoman twists his arm harder behind his back. Lex admits in order to use the Book of Destiny you must focus on what you want without hesitation, when question what he focuses on, Supergirl answers that it is his hatred for Superman. Lex confirms she got it on her first try. Lex Luthor surprisingly cautions them, killing someone is easy, but trying to bring back an entire universe or world would drive the person insane. Just like Deegan. Kate puts Lex back in his invisible cell, concoctions Kara against using the book, as they don't know what kind of effect it could have. She questioned since she is the Paragon of Hope maybe she is supposed to do this, in order to bring back Earth and Argo City, upset Kara leaves the room.</div>
                                                  <h3>Earth-666 - Los Angeles</h3>
                                                  <div class="box">John Constantine, Mia and Dig are all traveling together down the dimly lit alleyway with bright neon lights in the City of Angels. John knocks on a door only to have his old friend Lucifer answer. He has two beautiful women on either side of him, who he graciously sends away in order to conduct business. It is clear the two have a history, and after introducing himself, he hypnotizes Mia and seductively asking her what she wants. She confirms she's only here to find her father. John briefly explains it is of the utmost importance, and that Lucifer owes him. Never one to be in debt, Lucifer hands him a card with the devil on it. He warns they have until the card fades in order to find their friend. Happy to have finished his business, he closes the door on them. Mia is annoyed that he never told them how to get to Purgatory, but John assures them he already knows how. He holds the card out in front of them, while the card lights up, sending them all away.</div>
                                                  <h3>Purgatory</h3>
                                                  <div class="box">The three of them have found themselves on a replica of the Lian Yu island. Dig is surprised at their arrival, but Mia reminds them that the island's name is Mandarin for purgatory. John cautions them; a man without a soul is not easy to deal with, and will most likely not remember them.

                                                    Team Arrow is quickly losing time while looking for Oliver as their card has already begun to fade. They are all extremely surprised when a depressingly dressed Oliver Queen emerges from the forest attacking them, knocking out Dig and putting John in a headlock. Frantic, Diggle begins to try to talk down his long-time friend. Apologizing for not being there to help save him, but that no matter what they are brothers until the end. This seems to connect with the angry man before them, who puts John down and hugs his friend with both arms. He breaks away to hug his daughter as well.
                                                    
                                                    John reminds them it's time to immediately leave. Before they can, the group is interrupted with the presence of another man. His name is Jim Corrigan. He is an older man with dark hair and a slim trim. He informs them that he used to be a decorated police officer, but was eventually called to a higher purpose to become a spectre, he says this while his eyes briefly glow green. Mai is unimpressed and tells him to leave. Jim turns to Oliver, informing him, it is now his turn, to serve a higher purpose. And that his destiny is to save everyone, otherwise all the universes and everyone he loves will perish. Oliver seems to know he can believe and trust this man and agrees. His daughter and friends are sent away, leaving Oliver alone once again.</div>
                                                    <h3>Nexus</h3>
                                                    <div class="box">Barry returns, confirming there are no quantum towers around. They all enter the hidden room together. Having left the old dingy brick laid halls, they enter a very clean and chic, futuristic-looking room. Cisco says the room has an intense amount of vibrational frequency surging through it. Pariah tells them that this is the nexus between the antimatter universe and their own. In the middle is a bright white light beaming up towards the sky and the energy is surrounded by red lights with a darker red vibrating in the front of it. Which just so happens to be the anti-matter's source of the wave. Frost questions if the blur is alive. Barry uses his speed to run forward, only to be very shocked and surprised to see Barry Allen from Earth-90 continuously running at light speed on a treadmill. The Earth-90 Flash warns him to stop, but Barry doesn't react in time and hits the force field surrounding the older man. Pariah reminds them that the last time they faced off against The Monitor the speedster disappeared in a puff of smoke and had been missing ever since. All part of the greater plan. The anti-Monitor corralled his speed and used it to build his antimatter cannon, which he tested by destroying the first earth, Earth-2. It is only then, that they realize both Harry and Jesse are now gone. It is during this time they realize Pariah is missing.

                                                      Flash insists they have to get their old friend off of the treadmill. He convinces Vibe that this is why The Monitor gave him his powers back, so he opens a portal directly in front of The Flash who unwillingly is forced through. Earth-90 Barry thanks them after hitting a wall, but insists he must go back. The canon begins to erupt as it powers down. Earth-90 Barry insists, unless he continues to power it, it will just immediately destroy all the remaining Earths as a countermeasure to keep him running.
                                                      
                                                      Team Flash is incredibly surprised to see a man dressed in black with two gold lightning bolts down his body entered the room. He demands to know where he is and who the people before him are, he then strikes at them with one of his lightning attacks. Before he can do it again, the Flash steps forward and sends his own attack back, but is sent flying against a monitor and crashes it. Pariah re-appears before them again introducing Jefferson Pierce as Black Lightning. Jefferson reluctantly informs them he was brought here to help as his world has been destroyed. Black Lightning cries Pariah should've saved his family instead of him. Earth-1 Barry Allen tells him he understands how he feels, but right now they have to try and save the Earth they are currently on, as it will be the final Earth and all the multiverse will be destroyed. They asked Black Lightning for his help which he agrees to, absorbing the electricity from the machine, giving Team Flash more time. Realizing they are quickly running out of time, both Barry Allens use their super speed to begin communicating. Earth-1 Barry confesses how worried he is, the more time they waste another world dies, and he can't lose his wife. Earth-90 Barry reveals to him he was married once too. Her name was Tina and her purpose in life was to keep him running, and he's been doing that for the past 30 years. This caused something in Earth-1 Barry to click, finally understanding what The Monitor meant that day in the Time Vault. Realizing that this is what he has been running towards all these years. Insisting it's time for the Flash to "vanish in Crisis". Cisco informs them, "reversing the trail mellows directional velocity could make the antimatter wave received and funneled back into the speed canning, destroying the machine, once and for all" Realizing it must be him, Barry begins to say his goodbye to his friends. Commenting that Caitlin and Cisco were the first people he ever saw after becoming/when he opened his eyes that day in the S.T.A.R. Labs. Insisting he couldn't have been a hero without them. He adds to tell his wife and Joe how much he loves them and they both promised to do so. He is interrupted by the older Flash apologizes before momentarily stealing his speed. Telling him that when you've been a speedster as long as he has, you pick up some neat tricks. Earth-1 Barry cries out wanting to know why, Earth-90 Barry says The Monitor said The Flash had to die during Crisis, but he never said which Flash. Wanting the younger man to live a longer life. He takes a moment to tell Jefferson how amazing a hero he is too. He then instructs Cisco to open the breach. Cisco is hesitant, but the older man reminds him that this way his friend won't have to die, while Earth-1 Barry pleads for his friend not to do it. Reluctantly, Cisco opens the breach allowing Earth-90 Barry through. Once on the treadmill he begins running at super speed again, Cisco opens another breach for them to escape through, everyone leaves as Cisco forces Barry to come with them. Now that Earth-90 Barry is left alone in the room, he holds onto his final moments of remembering his wife Tina before the energy destroys him. He managed to stop Earth-1's immediate destruction, saving everyone. All that is left behind is the lightning bolt symbol from his chest.</div>
                                                      <h3>Earth-1 - Ivy Town</h3>
                                                      <div class="box">With the antimatter cannon down, the entire skyline of Earth-1 has turned the same daunting red as all the other worlds prior to it. Ray, Iris, and Ralph all find Dr. Ryan Choi alone in his laboratory on the phone to his wife. He immediately gets off the phone when he realizes his hero, Dr. Ray Palmer is standing before him. He is incredibly shocked and surprised, and begins gushing over him, insisting his second paper on subatomic density manipulation was the foundation for his work on miniaturization. Iris interrupts them insisting they need him to come with them immediately. Ray quickly explains they're heroes, and the doctor for obvious reasons does not believe that. Elongated Man takes this time to stretch out his arm across the room and give the man a Kleenex. They insist Ryan is a Paragon and they need him to help save the universe, quite freaked out by everything Ryan backs out of the room, wanting to spend his final moments with his wife and child.

                                                        Ryan is frantically packing his things at his office but takes a moment to look at a photo of his wife and child. He is interrupted by the arrival of Iris who congratulates him on his beautiful family. Ryan tells her that she is not like her, and he is a normal human being. Iris informs him that she is also a regular human being. The doctor notices her ring and asks if she doesn't also want to be with her husband. She mentions that her husband is not like them, and he is a hero. But it is them, who reminds the heroes what they are fighting for. He mentions his daughter, and Iris asks if he wants to hold his daughter knowing he did everything he could. He reluctantly agrees as Ray and Ralph come to stand behind her. Ray tells Iris that Lois just informed them that six more Earths have van to come with them.
                                                        
                                                        Iris reminisces saying goodbye to her husband back on the Waverider. The two shared a tender goodbye, both believing it might possibly be their last. Barry promises Iris that no matter what he will always come running home to her.</div>
                                                        <h3>Earth-1 - Waverider</h3>
                                                        <div class="box">Lois Lane is watching a monitor and is devastated to watch Earth-73 be destroyed by the wave. The Monitor is beside her and she informs him that there are only seven remaining worlds. Lois brings up how ironic the situation is, the biggest event in history to ever happen and no one will ever read the story. The Monitor brings up how these Earths were not the only ones destroyed, his world also died and he lost his family. He reminisces his life and how they meant everything to him. He now wishes he had spent more time with them and not been so focused on his work. They are interrupted by Superman returning from somewhere. He smashes his fist down against the floor, devastated at having not been able to save what was most likely Earth-73. She asked her husband's counterpart if he wishes to take a break. He ignores her and begins a speech about why he wears his family's crest, because it is to save people, and that he would never give up fighting. Lois asks why he turned the blue that used to surround the 'S' into black. He tells her it is because even in the darkest times, hope cuts through. "Hope is the light that lifts us out of the darkness." he asked to be sent back, to another Earth to try and save them. He disappears and Lois comments on his bravery, only to realize The Monitor has also disappeared and she is alone. Supergirl is in the ship's office looking at the Book of Destiny, debatably getting ready to open it. She is stopped by Kate. Her friend asks her what she is doing, and Kara insists she has to do whatever she can to bring her world back, and all the other worlds and she can fix it. Kate insists that is not the answer, Kara is thoroughly becoming more annoyed and asks what else can be done. She can't stand by while all those people are dying. Batwoman says she doesn't like it, but using the book will destroy her. Supergirl says it's what she has to do, and Batwoman says that she will stop her. Kara promises that Kate will not be able to. Kate is unsure how she would bear in a fight even with the kryptonite, and tries her best to talk her friend down. Rationalizing that if she does this and it doesn't work they can't risk having something happened to her because she is the Paragon of Hope, and without her, they will all be doomed. Annoyed at her reasoning, Supergirl reluctantly leaves. Kate lets out a breath of air she didn't realize she had been holding.

Later Kate takes a moment to track down Kara. Telling her she understands why Kara wanted to bring those people back, and how she has the biggest heart of anyone she's ever met, but she can't get hurt, it would open them to danger. Kara complements her for being the Paragon of Courage, admitting it took a lot to stand up against a Kryptonian. Kate sees how good of a person Supergirl is, and decides to give her the Kryptonite that she took off Bruce. Believing her friend is a good person, Kara tells her to keep it and that she "[has] the courage that [Kate]'ll never have to use it"

Both Supermen and Lois Lane are in the controlled rooms when they are surprised to find John Constantine, Dig and Mia all appear before them. They are defeated and say Oliver would not come back with them. Dig apologizes to Sara and asks how everyone else did. They are told how Barry was able to stop that antimatter, and Earth-1 is all that remains.

In another room Barry Allen finds Jefferson. He tries to console him, but he believes nothing is going to be okay again. The Flash tells them how Earth-90's Flash died, and he coincidentally looked exactly like his father Henry Allen. A man who was imprisoned for most of Barry's life after one of Barry's enemies framed him from murdering his mother. Jefferson opens up about his father Alvin Pierce was also a good man and a reporter. But he was murdered by Tobias Whale when he was 12. He made sure to carry on the lessons his father taught to his children. They agree that neither of their fathers were quitters, so they must honor their memories and "rage against the dying of the light". Having first had a rocky start, the two men shake hands and re-introduce themselves with their full names.

The Waverider announces Iris, Ralph and Ray have returned with Dr. Choi. Iris runs to her husband, relieved he is alive. Barry tells her that, Allen from Earth-90 sacrificed himself. Iris isn't all that phased, as long as she has her husband. They introduce everyone to Black Lightning who immediately takes note of both Supermen and is astonished that they are not just stories. They also announced they have the paragon of humanity and introduce Ryan, as he is going to help them save the world. Jefferson and Dig briefly locked eyes with a nod of acknowledgment at each other.

Now that everyone is back together, they began discussing, what to do next, but are interrupted with the arrival of Lyla. She appears before them and Dig immediately goes to hug and kiss his wife. She tells them with all the worlds disappearing her powers were not working how they should be, she also admits she doesn't know where exactly she has been. Team Flash is concerned why the Anti-Monitor would want Harbinger back on the ship, as he's possibly been controlling her the entire Crisis. They become further concerned when Pariah appears, as he is only to arrive before great tragedy.

The Harbinger turns around to everyone with her eyes glowing white. She is possessed by the Anti-Monitor and announces "It's time to end the age of heroes and everything you hold close" before throwing Dig against a wall. Superman and Black Lightning both try to fight her, but are both quickly overpowered. Not wanting to waste anymore time, the anti-Monitor forces everyone to the ground unable to move. There he tells Novu how foolish he has been for trying to stop him. The Monitor tells Mobius it was foolish to allow his creation in the first place. The two begin to attack each other with their power in the form of bright energy being forced in the other's direction. Unfortunately, Mobius wins and is able to destroy Novu, and take his powers. However, before he dies Novu is able to tell Pariah, that he will know what to do when the time comes.

The Waverider interrupts them with an alert that Earth-1 has been destroyed. The Anti-Monitor quotes that he will be victorious in a matter of seconds. The Waverider informs them that they have exactly 28 seconds. In that moment, Pariah realizes what he must do. Before that wave can hit them, he vanishes the seven Paragons away. J'onn tries to alert everyone before he too is banished, followed by Sara in the med bay beside Oliver's body. Pariah proudly announces that he has sent them away. Superman, Lois, Black Lightning, Iris, and Ralph all remain on the ship determined to go down standing. Before disappearing Superman gives a final nod to Iris, still believing everything is going to be okay.</div>

                                                          <div class="box">Batwoman and Superman find themselves close together both wondering where they are. Sara explains they are at the Vanishing Point. A point outside of space and time. She remembered from her last visit many years earlier, it was still destroyed from when Leonard Snart blew it up. They all quickly realize Pariah sent them there knowing the anti-Monitor could not follow. Barry begins to panic, telling everyone they have to go back, but he is stopped when Superman starts to have red glowing shards coming from his body. He feels something is wrong, while Supergirl holds him, begging him not to leave. He disappears and is replaced by Lex Luthor to everyone's horror. He exclaims how happy he is that his plan work, and he replaced Superman as the "Paragon of Truth." Admitting he had the Book of Destiny and decided to write his name in over Superman's. He is now one of seven people in the entire universe that is left. All seven paragons are trapped together.</div>

He affectionately calls her The Monitor as she's monitoring his time travel. He steps into the portal and arrives at the dawn of time but something goes horribly awry as antimatter begins to corrupt the temporal zone. A hole in the universe is subsequently created, and Mar Novu ends up being sent to a different universe all together, the anti-universe in fact, which results in the creation of the Anti-Monitor.

                                                            Through the speaker comms, he apologizes to his wife, saying that because of his ambition, he has subsequently doomed them all.</div>

Ryan Choi writes a letter to his now deceased wife, to give him some semblance of comfort. He explains how he just don't see why he was chosen as paragon. He then goes on to explain how "the so-called Paragon of Destiny doesn't even believe in tomorrow anymore. That the Paragon of Courage spends everydays working herself to the bone, training for a fight that will never come. Then there's the Paragon of Honor, who just meditates, for hours and hours on end. Dr. Choi goes further writes that the Paragon of Hope has lost hers, and as for him, he spends his days trying to re-purpose the broken technology lying around this place trying in vain to find a way out. In his letter, he doesn't have the nicest things to say about Lex Luthor, who used the Book of Destiny to rewrite reality and take the place of Clark Kent (Earth-96), the real Paragon of Truth. Ryan goes onto say that there are a lot of ways to describe Lex Luthor...But that he personally finds douchebag to be the most descriptive. He finishes his letter by saying that as for Barry Allen, AKA The Flash, AKA the Paragon of Love is just gone.

                                                              Lex and Ryan reveal to the other Paragons that they have come up with a teleportation device and Supergirl volunteers Lex to try it out, but it doesn't work. Lex admits that it was a long shot anyway.

Barry is shocked to learn that, because to him he had just left them two seconds ago. He tells them that there's no way of here, and that not even the Speed Force can get them out.</div>

The ultimate fight. He goes onto explain that the Anti-Monitor is more than just the Monitor's adversary, but rather, is the being that stands between all that ever was and all that ever will be. Jim describes the Anti-Monitor as the apocalypse itself given life and form, and terrible purpose.

Barry refuses to listen to the other, and says that anything is better than just staying here in the Vanishing Point.

It's complicated". He explains that he is Oliver Queen, but has also become something more. When Barry asks for clarification, Oliver replies by saying that some may call him a ghost or a spectre that is attuned to the entire multiverse.

Oliver reveals to the Paragons that the Anti-Monitor is at the dawn of time trying to make his antimatter universe permanent, and that they need to go and stop him.

Thus, they need a back up plan, which turns out to be that they need to split up. Some of them will go to the dawn of time, while the other will go to Maltus, to try and stop Mar Novu from unintentionally creating the breach that started it all from ever happening in the first place.

Olives says yes, but warns Barry that it's very dangerous. But Barry tells his friends that he needs a boost because everyone’s lives depend on them. Oliver touches Barry's forehead, and says that it's done, but that he needs to use this newfound power with caution.

So Barry nods, and says he trusts Oliver with every cell of his body.

Oliver explains that the Anti-Monitor attacked them, and as result, they all got separated. He adds that this includes him too, and that he's somewhere in the Speed Force as well, using various pieces of his essence to keep himself, Sara, Kate and J'onn together.

He is using their memories of their friends and closest allies to keep all of them from falling out of the Speed Force. Because if they do fall out of the Speed Force, they will be consumed by antimatter like everyone else before them. Oliver explains that he can buy Barry time but that he needs to get to each of them before it's too late. Barry argues that the Speed Force is infinite, and he wouldn't know where to look. Oliver tells him before he disappears, to remember what he just said about memories and connections. He goes on to say that he needs to take into account their greatest victories, their most crushing defeats, and the moments when the bonds between them were forged.

The other Flash asks him about the situation, and the Flash from Earth-1 says he's asking himself the same question. Earth-1 Barry says that this can't be happening, and asks the other Flash what he's doing here. The other Flash tells him that he'll tell him that when Earth-1 Barry tells him where here is. He asks The Flash from Earth-1 if this is his cosplay and asks him if he wants a selfie. Barry says no, that he's The Flash, but the other Barry Allen has no idea what Earth-1 Barry is even talking about. Earth-1 Barry says it's complicated. The other Flash tells Earth-1 Flash that he likes his outfit and that it looks very comfy. Earth-1 Barry tells the other Flash, he likes his suit too and says that it seems safe and cool. Amazed, the other Flash says that Earth-1 Flash's outfit looks very breathable. They then introduce themselves and both say they're Barry Allen. The other Barry asks what does that even mean, whereas Earth-1 Barry says that this should be impossible now. He then begins to ask the other Barry but ends up not finishing that sentence. The other Barry pleads with Earth-1 Barry to not do this to him. But then he begins to disappear, as he says that he told Victor this was possible.</div>

He approaches Oliver, who remembers everything. Barry confronts Oliver and asks him why he made a devil's bargain with the Monitor the year before.[4] Oliver disagrees, and says it wasn't a devil's bargain, and that he'd make the same choice again in a heartbeat.

Ryan gets Mar out of the way so that Supergirl and Lex can fight. Ryan tries to convince Mar that he can't open the portal, pleading with him. On their way out, Mar Novu sees his wife unconscious on the floor. Ryan manages to convince Mar Novu not to go through with his experiment as the cost would be too great.

                                                                              He then tells Kara and Lex they need to stop fighting, and Lex remarks how Ryan just ruined a perfectly good bad guy plan. The 7 paragons and Oliver then end up on the antimatter universe, home of the Anti-Monitor after Barry whisked them all there.

However, the Anti-Monitor is already there waiting for them. The Anti-Monitor tells the Paragons that some fates are inescapable, that they may have stopped one version of Mar Novu from going through the experiment, but that another version of him did go through with. He then begins to unleash his army of Shadow demons.

When Ryan says he's still unclear on what that all means, Oliver answers that it means they are all powerful enough to hold the line; to buy them the time they need to rebirth the universe. He explains that the dawn of time is the only place where this do over can happen. He goes onto say that he will light the spark, but they need to fan the flame. When Lex asks how they will do that, Oliver replies that Lex'll know when it's time.

Oliver is convinced otherwise and that he believes his entire life has prepared him for this fight. The Anti-Monitor says that all life ends, and that only death is eternal.

They focused on Hope, Destiny, Humanity, Love, Truth, Courage, and Honor. The resulting blast makes the Anti-Monitor disappear. With Oliver dying, Barry brings Sara to him, and he makes both of them promise to watch over his family, as he passes away.

She's back in her apartment after appearing to have fallen asleep on her couch.

                                                                                Alex is also there and talks about how she’s finally up. Startled, Kara ends up inadvertently using her heat vision on the wall near their fridge. She asks Kara if she had a bad dream, and Kara answers that she doesn’t really know. Kara then asks her sister how she got here, and Alex says that Kara fell asleep in front of the TV.

Kara then goes onto repeat “the Dawn of time” several times, which makes Alex wonder if that was what she was watching before she nodded off. Kara pulls the curtains and says how this isn’t right.

She asks Kara once again if she’s sure she’s fine, and Kara says she is. Before she leaves, Kara tells Alex she loves her, and Alex also says it back.

Nia tells Kara not to worry though, that she saved her a seat, but a lady from The Gazette is giving her angry eyes.

Nia laughs telling Kara she has some good timing. She tells Nia that she had a really weird dream last night, and was wondering if she could help her interpret it.

Nia laughs saying how, "that's dramatic, even for us". Everyone aside from Kara stands up to clap when it’s announced that Lex Luthor was the winner for the 2020 Nobel Peace prize. Kara asks if she's still dreaming. To which an oblivious Nia, says that she's glad this award is going towards someone who truly deserves it.

He goes onto say that he supposes that’s why people love superheroes so much; the power; the Chutzpah of someone who can fly faster than a speeding bullet.

He reiterates that he can't leap tall buildings in a single bound, but goes onto say that he has dedicated his entire life to fighting on the side of humanity. He says that to be recognized for that, is more than he can ever put into words, so he finishes his speech by saying that he stands with mankind.</div>

However, this one, in particular, meant a lot to him. Kara still can’t believe what she’s hearing, and wonders how people can think he’s a good guy; to which Alex says that Lex Luthor is the best guy.

Alex then reveals to Kara that Lex is their boss, and his number one supporter; besides Lena of course.

Barry arrives not too long after throwing Weather Witch into the air; apologizing by saying that's one of his. Initially wondering what each other is doing on their Earth, both realize that they seem to be on a composite of their Earths.

The older man reveals that normally they have Green Arrow and a Legend or two to help them out. He continues on by saying that last year, even Batwoman joined in.

Confused, Ray asks Sara if she's okay. Sara asks Ray what is the last thing he remembers and is perplexed to have Sara asking him if he doesn't remember coming to this very same bar for trivia night, and then getting magically transported to an alternate Waverider. She then goes onto tell him they were called to help stop the Multiverse from getting destroyed.

Sara asks Ray how he knew J'onn from Supergirl's Earth, but Ray is confused at the idea that Supergirl has her own Earth. J'onn reveals that this is not the case anymore because when they restarted a universe, their worlds combined, and only the Paragons have any previous knowledge that things used to be different.

They are then attacked by the shadow demons and are telepathically told by J'onn that the Paragons are being hunted down.

Labs research facility, Supergirl, Martian Manhunter, Batwoman, White Canary, The Flash, Black Lightning, and Superman are all gathered as they look at Oliver’s Green Arrow suit now on display in front of a U.S. flag hanging there.

                                                                                                            Kara thanks Oliver and says that the world has hope again and that she does too. She promises that they will never forget him.

Sara says that she has lost a lot of people that she loves, but that she had never imagined her life without him in it. She says he was always there for her, and that he changed her fate for the better.

Jefferson tells Barry that while he didn’t ever meet Oliver, he must have been a good dude. Jefferson then asks Barry why he brought them all to a condemned building.

He mentions that what’s even better is the fact that no one knows it exists, and this is good for them in the long run. He tells the other heroes that he figured they could all use this place to gather if anything ever happens again.

Martian Manhunter agrees, saying it’s a better option than all of them dropping by the DEO with Lex running things now. Jefferson asks why they even need it and wonders how often the world comes to an end.

A giddy Barry tells the other heroes that he hasn’t even shown them the best part and takes off the cloth covering what looks to be a large round table with a crest that has a large star in its center.

An empty 8th seat is left to honor Oliver's memory that has an arrowhead symbol on it.

Alex, now with her memories restored by J'onn tries to comfort Kara in their new reality. After defeating the Anti-Monitor, multiple worlds merge together, including Earth-1 and Earth-38, now becoming Earth-Prime. J'onn told them that only the Superfriends, Team Flash, Team Arrow and the Legends could have their memories restored, as doing so to the entirety of Earth could drastically alter lives (as loved ones and family could be different or mixed as as a result of the merged realities). Before finishing her doughnut, Kara decides to tell Lena she is Supergirl, even after Alex insists they start with a new slate.

                                                                                                              Lena wakes up in her apartment to find Lex there. He hands her a drink for her nerves as she slowly begins to remember Earth-38's destruction, and their own eventual demise from the Anti-Monitor. Lex informs her that he made a deal that included bringing her back with all memories. Lena snidely quips she must be in Hell if Lex is there with her; though she accepts she's not dead and Lex, unfortunately is back too. She is still annoyed at him for all his past deeds but Lex isn't worried and insists they move pass that and start working together. Lena declines, but not before bringing up Leviathan. In an unexpected turn of events, Lex is perplexed as to what Leviathan is.

Lena cuts are often, informing or she already knows everything and is once again insulted at Kara's attempt- as far as she sees it- to manipulate her into being her friend again. Supergirl discusses her wishes for them to work together and Lena informed her she is debating between her and her brother. Supergirl, unsure what else to say, leaves. Brainiac and Nia are walking together in the park when they come upon their favorite food truck and are incredibly surprised to find Barney Fife is already ordering the exact same drink. They are both rather confused and begin trying to arrest one another while insisting they are the real Brainiac. They bring each other into the DEO, and Alex tries to sort the situation out but they are soon surrounded by multiple Brainys, including one female. There is even a fourth one, from Earth-TUD18, however, almost immediately after meeting him, he dies, but not without warning them "beware of the bottle." Everyone stands around him discussing what that could mean, and all of their different personalities begin to emerge, with the one from Earth-TUD17 clearly being the most skittish. However, they are all interrupted by Lex Luthor instructing Alex and Kara to meet with him in the board room.

                                                                                                              Reluctantly both sisters comply and Lex is there in a full suit, ready to talk business. He questions if there is any more news on the Anti-Monitor or Leviathan. Unbeknownst to them, he does not remember what Leviathan is. They informed him they have heard nothing about the Anti-Monitor since the start of Earth-Prime, and they have no news on Leviathan either. Lex smoothly brings up how they should be semi-working together, while still keeping an eye on one another. If they agree, he expects them by his side publicly, at the Man of Tomorrow Ceremony. If not he will have his answer. While giving a briefing to a room of her team members Andrea is interrupted by her old college mentor Gemma Cooper. Later while examining her work with Obsidian North's "Collective Dream" VR lenses she was impressed in the new advances Lena has made and brought up the idea of having a virtual reality for people that are broken or unable to function in high society. Andrea was intrigued.

                                                                                                              Back at the DEO both other male Brainiac-5s were about to figure out things faster than Brainiac Prime. He is slightly embarrassed, but Barney Fife tries to comfort him telling him to not worry about it. They all had to Al's bar realizing that it is the common denominator where everyone inside are from multiple Earth's that were brought to Earth-Prime and doppelgängers. Making copies of Brainy as well as the bar owner Al Crane. Even bringing the three ancestral witches that created Reign. However, on Earth-TUD17 they were nothing extraordinary. They came to National City as tourists and never left. Even coming over to asked to do a palm reading for five dollars.
                                                                                                              
                                                                                                              Lena finds her mother, Lillian who has already been briefed by Lex on what has happened, as she had not had her memories restored like everyone else by J'onn. It appears she is quick to adverse herself in what her son has said (as she is notably not in jail on Earth-Prime) and advised Lena to work with Lex over Supergirl.

She asks about his personality inhibitors and why he is blue instead of green. Brainy brushes her off.
                                                                                                              
                                                                                                              Upon Brainy's request, Nia goes to find the sad Brainiac 5, who has been having a difficult time during his transition. However, it is quickly revealed that he is not as skittish as he has been pretending and is in-fact the source of the alleged virus they have all been looking for. Admitting in order to save his homeworld, Earth-TUD17 he shrunk it inside a tiny bottle and is now desperately looking for a way to bring it back. Nia realizing how much chaos it would cause to open an entire planet inside of Earth and tries to stop him but is quickly defeated. She calls out Brainy who along with Supergirl rushed to her aid but Brainiac 5 escapes into wormhole.
                                                                                                              
                                                                                                              While in recovery, Nia informs them what other Brainiac 5 told her. Querl Dox admits their ancestors used to do such as chaotic thing. Not long after Brainy confided in Supergirl about his personality inhibitors. He brought up the story of when he was a child at around eight and his parents had taken him to visit snow for the first time. He was so amazed and entranced by it, he refused to leave. So his mother bottled the entire planet for him. His father was furious at what had happened and restored the planet, but Brainy was furious that his father had taken away his planet. His property. His rage and anger had become so intense it scared his father who placed three personality inhibitors on him. And they stayed there to that day. However, they decreased his Brainy function and cut him off from the Big Brainy. Supergirl told him she believed he would make the right choice and that he was strong enough, he didn't need them anymore and believed he could control his emotions. Back at Al's Dive Bar, they found Brainiac 5 had incorporated the help of the three ancestral witches to help bring back his planet. They had all agreed, feeling their powers had always been under utilized. Supergirl, Brainy, and Dreamer all arrived to stop them. With Selena insisting it had been a while since they had a good bar fight. Brainy fought his double. While Nia and supergirl took care of the witches.

                                                                                                              Nia uses her powers to blast away the shrunken earth easily due to it's miniscule size, away from the witches. After Brainy was knocked down, he'd damaged one of his personality inhibitors again, Nia told him she believed he could control himself and he took all 3 off for the first time in his life. His demeanor and personality notably changed as he appeared to gain more confidence and self-control, accompanied by the change in his skin color to green.
                                                                                                              
                                                                                                              He was able to eventually talk down on emotional and distraught Brainiac 5, who after an anguished cry reluctantly agreed to hand over the bottled planet. He and the three witches all decided to wait together inside.
                                                                                                              
                                                                                                              After everyone had cleared out from the dive bar, Brainy and was left with Barney Fife and Querl Dox. There they admitted they had no use for this new world and wish to return to the constructive Brain, giving up their physical selves. In doing so, Brainy would receive their knowledge. Before the female Querl Dox was absorbed, she admitted that she had desperately been trying to find information about Leviathan and Lex Luthor. Informing him that in her world, she had become his adversary and in doing so had almost destroyed everything and everyone. Because Lex Luthor can't be beat. She insisted that Brainy Prime not become his enemy. The only way to do this was for him to have no other-worldly distractions including romantic relationships or friendships.

He had brought a truth seeker and allowed her to ask him any questions. To which he admitted, he did want a genuine partnership as they would work well together, and would dismiss her as soon as he no longer had use of her. She hesitantly agreed.

He confidently met up with Nia before swiftly informing her their relationship was over. He left her heartbroken as he walked out.
                                                                                                              
                                                                                                              At another ceremony for Lex Luthor, Kara found William hanging out in the corner. There he admitted he didn't trust the Luthor's as one of his close friends back in England had declined to work with him before ending up dead. Kara insisted that it was only Lex Luthor and that Lena was a good person. During the ceremony, Lex's entire family was there, and after Lena had finished introducing him, his mother told him how she had persuaded Lena to join him. Adding that since they had been partners in the previous world she wished to continue that. unaware that he had betrayed her too.

He would inform Lex of all incoming information about Leviathan and they'd be partners. Lex agreed and showed him a photo of a wanted man, possibly from the future that had been arrested. The photo was of Winn Schott's doppelgänger.</div>

Not long after finishing, a bus transporting prisoners drives by and snags on the wire, flipping it over. The bus lands on its side and an unscathed Winn Schott emerges from the bus.

                                                                                                                Not long after his escape, Winn and Lex are sharing drinks inside of Lex’s makeshift office. Winn is rather surprised that Lex, a billionaire and philanthropist, is aiding a criminal. Lex then requests his presence at the upcoming Toycon. Outside the van, Lex is greeted by his sister Lena and, after a quick argument, the two strike a deal. Lena was also surprised to find Brainy with Lex; however, he confirms that he has no emotional conflict as he is 100% positive that what Lex is doing is beneficial for the future. Lex smirks that he is on the right side of history. Lena agrees to befriend her former friend and current nemesis Andrea in order to find out more information about Leviathan. In return, Lex will get her all the information she requires on Q-Waves, as they had changed frequency on this Earth, and she was unable to obtain information on them.

However, she insists she is fine as Brainy is discovering who he is and if it wasn't meant to be, it wasn't meant to be.

Both are keeping up their friendly public personas, before William interjects and quickly accuses Lex of basically murder. Lex denies any wrong-doing and asked to have a quick word with Kara. She confirms they are playing by his rules he set out previously and doesn't know what got into William. Lex reminds her to keep him in check, and in a very comical manner grabs her recording device and says “Kara Danvers is Supergirl” forcing her to destroy it in her hand. The D.E.O. and Supergirl are eventually called to the con when they discovered tiny miniature monkeys much like the ones Toyman used to use. Supergirl shields the rest of the convention center with her cape before they explode. They are both extremely surprised to find Winn up in the galley with the rifle pointed at Chester Dunholtz. Supergirl speeds off to stop the bullet but it is stopped by another Winn on the ground floor dressed in a superhero uniform. When Alex and Supergirl look back up into the rafters the first Winn is gone. Supergirl chases him down but he is replaced by a robot toy.

                                                                                                                Winn scans the building for the impostor but is unable to find him. All three take note of where they are and hug in the miniature reunion with their old friend. He explained since going to the future he is now a part of The Legion, and has a wife and daughter. He came back to the past because time cops arrived at his house accusing him of murder in the past. He came back to clear his name. Brainy shows up and rather awkwardly agrees to look into the matter. He is uncomfortable working both sides but his behavior is not picked up by his friends.
                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                Lena has a private meeting with Andrea and apologizes for how she treated her and broke off their friendship 10 years ago, saying she now understands what happened and that she was under the control of Leviathan and had no choice. Andrea is obviously overwhelmed but relieved that Lena no longer hates her. Agreeing to help her, Andrea confirms she has had zero contact with Leviathan. It appears she has been a sleeping agent for the past 10 years. On her way out, Lena calls her brother to inform him of the situation.
                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                The gang visit J'onn in his office study and discovered he has added a secret wall that encloses an elevator and leads to a secret headquarters. J'onn and Winn embrace each other, having not seen each other for two years. J'onn then adapts Winn’s brain to the previous timeline, when Lex was still a villain, and before all the Earth's merged. Winn is obviously overwhelmed by this nuclear information and begins having a slight panic attack. They are interrupted by the doppelgänger Winn, who comes on their screen informing them of part of his upcoming plot. The real Winn is unable to track him and doesn't understand the technology that is being used. The doppelgänger Winn has set up a blog and promises distraction once he receives 1 million followers. Winn finds a wanted poster for himself in the future for $12 million, dead or alive.

He also embraces Winn, and promises to look into the doppelgänger, again his behavior goes unnoticed.

Kara apologizes and she brings them both into her office to have Kara run a story about the traitorous Winn Schott, wanting to exploit Kara’s personal relationship with her former friend who disappeared two years ago. Kara tries to refuse, but Andrea demands she gets working on the story.

It seems clear that the doppelgänger understands that Earth-Prime was not his original universe. Kara brings along Nia to show her the new secret headquarters, she greets Winn having never met him before. However, he is ecstatic as he is close friends with her unknown amount-of-greats granddaughter in the future. This conversation is short-lived when she spots Brainy. She agrees to look for the doppelgänger and sits down, but in her vision all she sees is Winn turned into a white tiger before attacking her. She storms off angry past Brainy, telling him of the dream only showed her a wildcat.

                                                                                                                Outside she is consoled by Winn, who offers to try to translate the dream for her, but she insists it was a reference to her feelings about Brainy, as the nickname she gave him was 'wildcat'. Winn explains how he is the only human on the Legion, and as he has no powers, it was her great grand-daughter that allowed him to harness dream power. They are interrupted by Kara and the two old friends have a moment. Kara expresses how happy she is for Winn, and is so surprised at how he has matured with a wife and child now.

Looking at some old photos, he recognizes Gemma Cooper.
                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                After realizing that the attack was going to be at National City University, the team makes their way there while Andrea is giving a speech about Obsidian Platinum beside a white tiger mascot. She is attacked by that Tiger, who was really the doppelgänger. Everyone arrives and he soon calls into action at least four prophylactic tigers to fight the team while he makes his escape. Nia and Winn team up, and it is there that she finds out some new things her powers can do, after watching him harness them.

He doesn't care and sets off an explosion, but Winn is able to protect himself using dream magic and creating a force field around himself from the blast. With his demise, the giant robot cats fall down.

He is still in shock that another him would do something so horrible but relieved that his name is now cleared and he is no longer a wanted fugitive in the future. Kara is called away by William. Will shows her some photos he took of Lex at Fort Harrison paying off some guards. He wants to tell her something, but before he can, Kara insists they work together against Lex, not wanting him to get hurt. They agree and decide to become partners. Kara then invites him to game night but he declines. After seeing the sandwich he made for himself, she insists he comes with them. Back at the team's new headquarters, Winn and Brainiac have a moment, and Brainy admits to him everything. It has been weighing on him that he is working with Lex, but it is for the best as he was visited by other versions of himself in the future. And as hard as it is for him to do it, he must not tell anyone and give up all relationships. Winn invites Brainy to game night but he declines. Winn promises not to say anything, as he understands Brainy just needed an outlet.

                                                                                                                Lex arrives at Lena's office and gives her, as promised, all relevant information on Q-waves. Back at Kara's apartment, Kelly has joined them, as has William for a night of drinking and games. In another room, the doppelgänger's laptop opens up to a recording of himself.</div>

They are soon joined by William, and Alex convinces them to sing Africa together. While they are on stage, J'onn and Alex discuss Lex's involvement at the D.E.O.. She admits she updated some spyware onto the DEO internet, in order to follow all his movements. Meanwhile, Brainy makes a private phone call to Lex Luthor about Gemma Cooper. Lex is aware Alex has been spying on him and requests Brainy take care of the situation. Alex is called away on a mission while William tries to ask Kara on a date. Before she can answer, she is called away by Alex.

                                                                                                                  Back at the DEO, Winn recognizes the song being blared over the speakers as one he used to listen to as a child in his father's workshop. They realize they are dealing with an artificial intelligence, taking on the physical form of Evil Winn as Toyman. He has become hyper conscious inside the DEO’s internet. They realized the catastrophe he could create if he gains full access to the World Wide Web, there isn't anything he wouldn't be able to control. He has use of the Obsidian Platinum lenses to download himself onto a laptop, and Winn believes he can reverse engineer it, in order to create and execute a kill code. They are interrupted when Toyman is able to take control of the laser defenses, but Winn is able to temporarily shut him out. Alex arranges everything with a computer chip to be turned off and taken apart. Everyone is surprised to hear a telephone ringing, with Lex Luthor on the other line. He questions why the DEO is in lockdown and she informs him of the situation. He reminds her of the Kryptonite safeguards aimed at the planet. Brainy calls Lex back and is informed Lex was aware of a potential Toyman situation. He request Toyman's code to help fight Leviathan.

She is interrupted with the arrival of her fake friend Lena looking for updates. She asked for a sneak peek, but is informed they are not ready. When she offers her help with issues in the algorithm, Andrea politely declines. Back inside her laboratory, Lex greets a sister who is annoyed, as she needed access to Andrea's lenses in order to further her own work but was rebuffed. Lex promises to fix the situation for her.

Prior to separating, Brainy confirms to Winn that he is still working with Lex in order to protect the future. While inside together, Winn admits his dad stole his idea of creating a computer conscienceless, even using part of his own code. They briefly touch on her relationship with William and are soon greeted with the physical images of his father, Winslow Schott Sr. and his mind inside the computer. He claimed he was there to help his son, but Winn refuses to believe him. And when he tried to give them directions to safety, Winn takes the exact opposite route. In doing so, it puts them both briefly in danger as it would appear his father was telling the truth, as they are attacked by monkeys. Lex sits down at the table with Gemma. He is aware that she is board chair of Obsidian North, and brings up the issue they are having in the bio-link, and how Andrea refused his sister's help, claiming he was only offering his help in order for a future friendship to blossom. Gemma soon calls Andrea demanding to know why Lena Luthor was not allowed to help. She apologizes and promises to allow her in on their situation. Andrea immediately calls her, claiming she has changed her mind.

                                                                                                                  Alex finds Brainy and is furious at him for removing her spyware. He covers for his deceptive behavior by showing her the flaw in her theory, claiming Lex would have found out and when he did it would be serious. Putting spyware on his computer was too great a risk. Meanwhile, Supergirl and Winn are trying to manually enter the kill code but it is not working. The DEO is attacked with Krypto-bots, as evil Winn continues to take control. Supergirl is able to return to the main office in order to fight off the rest of the Krypto-bots, but is soon forced to back down when she is infected. Brainy is able to settle down the situation much to everyone's relief. Meanwhile, Winn is fighting his evil self while his father watches, trapped inside a glass room. After a physical fight between the two Winns, he is able to enter the kill code, with help from his father, leading to the physical conscious deaths of his father and evil Winn.
                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                  Lena finds her brother to thank him for getting himself involved in her problem with Andrea, leading to another breakthrough with Q-waves. Gemma has an impromptu meeting with the same old lady, Margot Morrison, that Eve met on a bench. Everyone gathers to say a final goodbye to Winn before he returns to the future. Alex decides to quit the DEO. At CatCo, William offers Kara a gift for her sick grandma; realizing she doesn't want to put him in harm's way, she politely declines his advances. While Brainy and Lex have a final conversation, Brainiac's heart is weighing heavy on him, but he is still able to give Lex the immortality code, and is promoted to DEO director.

Kara is unsure and so is Alex, and they are soon interrupted by J'onn arriving with pizza. Mr. Mxyzptlk confirms this is best orchestrated with just one person, and sends the other two on an extravagant paintball expedition, much to their enjoyment.

                                                                                                                    Kara is rather happy with her life but decides perhaps she could have worked things out in a more favorable manner with Lena, convinced if she had told Lena her secret identity earlier, they would still be friends. Mr. Mxyzptlk begins to play a video reel of all of their encounters together throughout knowing each other.

Mr. Mxyzptlk mocks Lena for her poor acting, and Kara ignores him. She finds a place and time from around then, eating lunch together at L-Corp.[1] Kara decides it's a good time to inform Lena. She again apologizes to her friend, understanding Lena has been betrayed so many times, before revealing her secret identity. Kara quickly leaves to take care of Mercy Graves' attack and when she returns, Lena is gone; she traveled to Metropolis to see Samantha. Lena immediately tells Sam that Kara is Supergirl, both surprised that they are one and the same. Lena felt Supergirl was horrible to her before this due to her stash of Kryptonite, and immediately starts to crumble at the idea of Kara thinking of her as a villain like the rest of her family. Sam tries to reassure Lena that she is a good person, having did what she did to save the former. Unfortunately in this new timeline, Supergirl dies when Agent Liberty poisons the atmosphere with Kryptonite, since Lena wasn't able to save her in time. Alex mourns at her sister's grave. Kara immediately asks to be brought out of this reality.

She immediately apologizes to Lena for not telling her sooner. Lena breaks down, crying that only three weeks ago she found out that Sam, one of her closest friends, was a homicidal Worldkiller. Lena is upset over how she went through it alone and Kara wasn't there for her, angry at Supergirl for lying to her. Supergirl again apologizes, insisting she was only trying to protect her. Lena refuses to work with Supergirl, insisting she can't be trusted. Supergirl collapses when the eclipse that was caused by the Worldkillers begins. After Kara is taken out, she admits she forgot about the eclipse and Kryptonite bomb, and is hurt that Lena doesn't help them.

Inside Patricia Arias' farm while waiting for Reign,[3] Kara asks Mon-El for his perspective on the situation with Lena. Mon-El assures Kara that she is such a compassionate person, and would never deliberately hurt Lena; she deserves the same respect and understanding from her friends. Kara thanks him for his words but they are interrupted by Reign. Lena arrives in the midst of their fight believes she can stop the Worldkiller without Kryptonite. After Reign seemingly recedes and Sam takes control, they celebrate. However, Reign reemerges and attacks Lena. Supergirl tries to save her but is injured and forced to watch Lena die. Mon-El angrily kills Reign but dies in the process as well. Heartbroken, Kara asks to again be removed from this reality.

They briefly skip over some of the BetaMyx tapes of Kara and Lena's friendship and Kara decides to tell Lena the truth when they recently met. Before their friendship is really established, Kara informs Lena of her identity and the two team up as political allies. Kara likes what she is seeing and asks to be put inside this reality. Lena is testifying against Lillian Luthor and refuses to give Kara's identity as Supergirl, yet is still able to win the court case. Outside, she runs into Ben Lockwood. He angrily reveals he was forced to close his family's steel factory after his father, wife and child all jumped off a building, believing Supergirl would save them due to joining the Cult of Rao. Lena apologizes for the tragedy. Ben demands to know who Supergirl is, believing that would stop people from attempting to be saved by her in the future. When Lena refuses, he then kidnaps her with the help of Otis Graves. Supergirl finds Winn to help her track down Lena and Thomas Coville. The kidnapper reveals the only way to save them is for Supergirl to reveal herself and she has one hour to decide. Kara does so and saves Lena in the nick of time. Afterwards, Agent Liberty and his followers target each of Supergirl's loved ones, including Cat Grant, in an explosion. The reality is ended.

She then thinks that maybe everything would've been all right if she never became friends with Lena. Mxyzpltk obliges and takes Kara into such a reality. However, she and Mxyzpltk are standing in rubble where Kara's loft used to be, and she is horrified. Kara and Mxyzptlk are then attacked by some A.I. robots. Kara fights them with help from Dreamer. They escape to the new D.E.O. where Alex, Mon-El, J'onn, Kelly Olsen, and Nia are all hiding out. Mon-El immediately recognizes Mr. Mxyzptlk and confronts him for his behavior the last time they met, when he tried to force Kara to marry him. Mxyzptlk genuinely apologizes for his actions. They are interrupted by their dictator, Lena Luther. She informs the people of National City that Supergirl is a terrorist and at large, working with a Fifth Dimensional being. After laying her propaganda, Lena declares that Supergirl will soon be destroyed. Kara learns that when Lena first came to the city, she was seriously injured by Lex's assassination attempt.[4] Two years later, Lena returned as a tyrant dictator and killed Lex, even destroying most of the city. They are soon attacked by two of her enforcers, Reign and Brainiac 5.
                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                    Mxyzptlk is still concerned with his missing powers; as long as Lena continues to harness Fifth Dimensional powers, he will be unable to use his. Winn remembers a hat infused with Fifth Dimension energy and Mxyzptlk recalls an old friend of his, leaving the group to retrieve his hat, which has enough Fifth Dimension power to get him and Kara out. The team are immediately attacked by Lena’s enforcers. Dreamer, Alex, and Kelly holds off Brainy, Kara and J'onn take on Reign, and Mxyzptlk, Winn, and Mon-El attempt to get the hat. J'onn tells Supergirl to go to Lena. She tries to reason with Lena, who is revealed to have Metallo's Kryptonite powers. Lena bitterly asks where Supergirl was when her adoptive mother experimented on her to save her life, in which the pain destroyed her. Lena begins to kill Kara with her Kryptonite heart. J'onn and Mon-El are able to work together, Winn finds the hat and Mxyzpltk uses it to transport Kara and himself out of this reality.
                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                    Finally able to return to Kara’s apartment, she and Mxyzptlk are physically and mentally exhausted from the ordeal. Mxyzptlk suggests they try again but Kara realizes telling Lena the truth is a lost cause; Lena will always be angry, and there will always be consequences. Kara decides it's best to live in this current timeline and deal with the situation as it comes. She tells Mxyzptlk that he still helped her, and hopes he is free of any burden of guilt. Mxyzptlk, in a very sobering confession, admits he was very lonely and didn't really like himself, which is why he acted so out-of-character and dramatic last time. Mxyzptlk thanks Kara for giving him a second chance, and making him feel genuinely good about himself. Both now friends, Mxyzptlk leaves to go visit Mardi Gras in the 1780s.
                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                    Kara makes one final visit to Lena at her apartment. Kara acknowledges she made a mistake in lying to Lena, but states that Lena can't keep blaming the former for her decisions. She warns that if Lena continues to work with Lex and go down such a dark path, then Kara will treat her just like any other villain. As Kara leaves, Lena looks after her, stunned and perhaps regretful at her former friend's words.

Kara has come to the realization that no matter what she did, it would never be good enough for Lena and their friendship is what it is. She hopes one day, Lena will be able to see past her bitter anger, but if not, there is nothing Kara can do.</div>

She is accompanied by Kelly and Kara and are soon met up with Nia. Kelly and Alex quickly make their escape when they see William walking towards them with coffee. He greets both of his colleagues respectively, having bought them their preferred choice of coffee. They enter work together, and are watching Andrea's promotional video for her upcoming release on her Obsidian North lenses. She instructs her staff to cover her business' Obsidian North's launch that is being heavily promoted everywhere. After giving everyone their assigned tasks, Andrea Rojas heads back to her other office but her elevator is physically damaged as the cabin is forced down towards the ground, from an inhuman purple energy. She is saved in time by Supergirl. The two discuss what just happened, and Andrea retells her side of the story and what she saw; Supergirl promises to look into the situation. But Andrea insists that her launch will continue forward.

                                                                                                                      Lena is in her laboratory conducting more research projects, this time between an alien creature and a small dog. After dosing them with Q-Waves the two are able to easily commingle. She is interrupted by her brother Lex, who has happily arranged human volunteer trials for the next stages of testing. Hesitantly, she agrees to go down to their family owned prison to greet them. When she arrives at the police station she is greeted by Steve Lomeli and personally witnesses him being physically and verbally abused by much larger inmates. After everyone is lined up and willingly subjected to Lena’s experiment she is pleasantly surprised that the former bully who had been picking on Steve has now had a notable personality change and even invites his former victim to have lunch together. She continues to monitor their behaviour, but sees nothing but positive results so far. However, hours later, Steve begins to show signs of negative personality change; it is immediately accompanied by crippling pain that leaves him unconscious and hospitalized. He eventually wakes up and immediately begs Lena to change him back, as his pain is worse than any physical beating he ever received at the hands of the other inmates, severely regretting his choice to trust her. Meanwhile Lex has another in-person meeting with the new D.E.O. director, Querl Dox, who continues to keep him apprised of all relative information. He is informed of the attempted attack on Andrea earlier, and decides to personally look into the matter. He tracks down Gemma Cooper at her work, and offers his services and the personal protection of Supergirl. Gemma is debating whether or not to take him up on his offer, but he insists Supergirl will not fail, and, with the entire world watching so closely, Leviathan does not need more eyes on them. Gemma agrees, but insists if Supergirl fails, the fallback will lie with him.

                                                                                                                      Supergirl is unimpressed when Lex orders her to personally protect her boss, Andrea before the launch of her VR lenses. She is confused in his personal interest in such a random issue, but he insists Andrea is the future and he is all about protecting the future. Reluctantly, Supergirl agrees to be Andrea's bodyguard for the day. The team also discusses who her possible attacker could be, and Brainy suggests xxx. Andrea, who already had zero expectations of stepping down from the limelight before her launch, is ecstatic to have Supergirl by her side for protection, even taking a quick selfie before posting it. Andrea steps away to greet an old friend, and Supergirl is greeted by William who has chosen, in spite of the danger, to follow Andrea around as he believes she is doing positive work for the world. Kara is slightly hesitant of William being there for the entire day. While Andrea is conducting another interview, they both watch from the sidelines, and Supergirl begins to see a softer side to him that she appears to like. The conversation is cut when Supergirl jumps into action to again save Andrea from the mysterious purple energy. Supergirl insists they both go into hiding and Andrea refuses, saying everything she has worked for and sacrificed so many parts of her life, including how much work and effort her own father put into it before he passed. Moved by her plea, Supergirl agrees to continue and allow them into the public, but insists that if there is any more danger, she is immediately evacuating them both. Andrea agrees to her terms.

They head down to the alien bar and greet their old friend Harry. He disagrees with Brainy's assumption about the attacks being from xxx, as they are a very peaceful race, he points them in the direction of an alien at the bar, his hesitant to talk as Alex, because she's personally arrested him before. J'onn promises they only want information, he reluctantly informs them what he knows, and instructs them to look into the alien Todd Sapphire who is a Chlorophillian. Alex calls Brainy to ask for a favor and use DEO resources in order to track down a location. Brainy is forced to lie as he does not want them crossing paths with what Lex is doing behind the scenes, he insists the house address is vacant and no one in the area has that name or matches their description. Having nothing else to do they both decide to head out there anyway. Meanwhile, Brainy’s conscience is beginning to weigh on him, he decides to reason his fears and conducts a conversation with one of his alternate selves. They agree what he is doing is for the betterment of the future, and though his friendships will suffer, it is for the greater good. Supergirl continues to follow Andrea around on her press tour. While Alex and J'onn arrive at the address to find an old abandoned barn. However they are soon attacked by its residents, and Alex was unable to use her weapon, and J'onn is left incapacitated due to the large fire and his alien weakness. Alex immediately calls out to Supergirl for help. Supergirl who is still at a press briefing, immediately flies Andrea to the safe spot at the DEO much do her surprised anger, and locates her sister and friend in the barn, putting out the fire in seconds and ensuring their safety. They confirm that they believed the alien race that was attacking them, are being mind controlled by a third-party. While looking over the destroyed evidence they find what appears to be a suicide letter, and are able to connect the dots, that it is his devastated wife, Amy Sapphire who is causing the chaos. She has entered and taken over CatCo Worldwide Media with explosives, demanding everyone evacuate. William refuses but is forced down at gunpoint by her. Supergirl arrives and they both attack each other. Amy is preparing to shut down and destroy everything related to the VR lenses. Brainy is contacted and attempts to override the system. However, it can no longer be disabled and must be manually typed in at CatCo. Andrea demands to be allowed to come with him, but Brainy refuses. She is physically locked up for her own protection but is able to escape with her undiscovered powers to transport herself to the control rooms with Brainy. He is extremely surprised to see her there, but she blows over his question to enter her killed code. However it is of no use as they have been changed. Inside the power plant, Supergirl is eventually able to talk the devastated widow down, her only goal was to stop others from the same self-destructive behavior as her husband.

After trying to work out what went wrong, Lena is able to tweak her work on the Q-waves to better fit Steve’s personality. As he was never hostile, he should have never been given that exact dose, instead it should have been altered for his kinder and less aggressive personality. She meets up with Lex back at her laboratory, and he congratulates her on a job well done.

Alex vents her frustration about not working at the D.E.O. anymore and how useless she feels. J'onn presents her with a Martian weapon, that can physically turn itself into anything. Alex and Kara meet each other up at her apartment over food, and after being pushed by her sister, Kara goes to find William, who is still at work even amongst the destruction. She acknowledges she pushed him away before but is willing to go on a date with him.

At the D.E.O., Brainy and Lex have one more conversation. He discovers Lex orchestrated offense in order to get in good with Gemma in order to get closer to Leviathan. Lex has one last meeting with Gemma inside her limo, insisting he only wants to be friends, in hopes that she would introduce them to the rest of her friends. Everything he is orchestrated has been to find out more information about Leviathan.</div>

Brainy arrives to take the alien into custody at the D.E.O. and the two have an awkward post-breakup interaction. Kara calls over her sister for fashion advice before her date; it is her first one since Mon-El and she is having butterflies. Both sisters scoff at the TV at the mention of Lex Luthor who is doing groundbreaking work with obsidian platinum. William and Kara go out for a game of pool, that she is winning.

The roommate blows off a guy trying to talk to her and when she goes outside looking for her date, it turns out to be the same man from inside the bar. He attacks her and Yvette is found by Nia. The next day at their apartment they call the police to report it, and Kara shows up concerned. Nia is angry as the man was trying to get to her, through her roommate. At work, Kara calls Brainy to inform him of the situation, asking if he could look into it, as he has more resources than the police. Al comes to J'onn hoping to find his missing brother, Trevor Crane. He explains he hasn't heard from him in a while and after going to a trial for Obsidian lenses, he hasn't been seen since. Alex finds Kelly wanting to know if she could locate a missing alien who they believe is still inside the game. She gives her the latest version of Obsidian lenses and instructs her how to track him. Once inside she skips past her personal options to find the connected world of VR Las Vegas. Once inside she is instructed to an out-of-place haunted mansion on a hill. Once inside she finds two people trapped in large glasses of water. She has a flashback of almost drowning, but is able to manage and help both escape. They explain they were here with Trevor and another person named Richard Bates. On the right track, Alex uses her Martian weapon to create a key and enter the obscured replace door. Meanwhile J'onn and Al are searching his apartment for clues. They meet with a woman who isn't able to give them much concrete information about the situation. Once Alex is inside she begins walking down the long hallway but loses communication with Kelly. She goes through a second door and finds Trevor, who is in a state of panic, insisting his body self-destructs randomly every couple of minutes no matter what he does. Alex is eventually able to talk him down, but they are interrupted by the infamous unknown Richard. Alex is physically able to take him but they quickly have to make an escape. They find Richard's physical body in the real world, and after being confronted by J'onn, he appears to die, as he becomes unresponsive and his Obsidian lenses turned red. Nia is disappointed with the police's investigation and sets up her own Upswipz profile to find out the assailant. She was able to get a match with the suspected assailant and dresses up as Dreamer for their date. He explains his disgust towards her, and she loses her temper and physically attacks him, weighing the option of killing him. Before she can, Supergirl arrives to talk her out of her anger. She insists Supergirl could never understand what she is going through, but Supergirl tells her that's not the point and killing is never the answer. Dreamer releases him and he is put into police custody.

Alex is surprised when she receives an unexpected phone call from her mother, informing her of the death of her father. She finds Kara to tell her the news. Meanwhile at the hospital, Margot has taken charge of Richard's body. He is transported to an unspecified location where his body is added to the collection of physically suspended people in the air, and on gurneys.</div>

Alex insists their father has already "died" multiple times, and even after they helped him escape, he was living close by this entire time and never once chose to reach out to his family. Kara explains it's not about Jeremiah, it's about being there for their mother Eliza, and paying respect to his memory in spite of his latest actions. Alex is too upset, insisting even when they were kids, Jeremiah paid more attention to Kara, concerning himself with her secret. Hurt, Kara refuses to engage with her sister, and decides to go on ahead to the funeral without her. J'onn leaves with Kara, and Kelly promises to try to work on Alex, though it's clear both sisters are furious with each other. Kelly, now left alone in the apartment with Alex, tries to persuade her against drinking more wine, but Alex only wants to be left alone. Kelly goes to work but urges Alex to reconsider not going to her dad's funeral. Once alone, Alex is bothered by another propaganda commercial of her sister on TV. She decides to try the new VR Obsidian Platinum lenses that were left behind by Kelly as a prototype. Alex is once again in the lobby with her fantasy options before her. Not currently interested in her desire to be a mother, she decides to pick being Supergirl.

                                                                                                                          William finds Kelly at work and the two discussed the Danvers sisters. Kelly says she's keeping her phone close in hopes Alex would change her mind. He discusses the missing persons' report and asked Kelly to look into it. Kelly later finds her boss Andrea and informs her of the broken escape link inside the game. Andrea insists the glitch was fixed, but bureaucracy was holding up the funding and she would look into it. Inside Alex’s fantasy world, she is at the mall and first greeted by Bonnie who is dressed up as Indiana Jones. She explains the game to her and how to identify non-player characters from players like themselves. They watch a live performance from Derek, before Bonnie is called away and climbs a rope to a helicopter through the mall ceiling. In reality, the guitar player is trapped inside VR, as his physical body is with a multitude of other people wrapped in silver in a specified laboratory. The VR mall is attacked by a Dracokardosian and Alex saves them. Afterwards Alex goes to a bar, and again runs into Bonnie's Indiana Jones. However this time it becomes more evident that she is less and less aware she is inside a virtual reality. Bonnie’s real-life body is inside a trailer, her lenses have also turned red and she is unresponsive. A group of people discreetly take her away.

                                                                                                                          Alex is called away by the D.E.O., where she finds Brainy and J'onn, who inform her that Hank Henshaw, the real Hank Henshaw, has somehow escaped and has now kidnapped her sister Kara. Alex immediately gets on the situation and flies off to confront Hank. They find each other in a dark abandoned building, and immediately begin to fight. Alex eventually gets the upper hand and defeats him. Alex has a heart-to-heart with J'onn outside on the balcony of the D.E.O. It is becoming more and more clear Alex believes she is the real Supergirl.

He is taken offstage and once again Alex is greeted by Indiana Jones, completely oblivious to her change in personality as well. While ordering a drink, she receives it on the house for saving the city. Alex is taken aback when she sees another Supergirl. The two greet each other and Alex is confused when she talks about how great this virtual reality is, and how everyone is entitled to free drinks as the bartender gives her two on the house, as she compliments her on her black style of the stereotypical Supergirl uniform. Alex is left confused, and immediately begins to panic. She forces herself to wake up and find herself inside her apartment and takes out her VR lenses. She is relieved to be out of the virtual reality, and upon hearing danger, dons her Supergirl outfits and flies off, still unknowingly stuck inside the reality.

She tries to call Alex from the game by turning it off, but when Kelly is unable to, she puts on a pair to follow her. Alex has just finished capturing Psi and putting her in a cell. Kelly finds her with Brainy and J'onn, and tries to call her back out of the reality. Kelly is left shocked when Alex clearly believes she is Supergirl and doesn't understand. They are worried that something has happened to Kelly and the boys try to take her away to be examined. Kelly immediately exits herself from the game. In the real world, Kelly contacts Andrea to explain the situation, and they make an artificial character of Alex as a teenager in order to communicate with her. Inside the game, Alex has just stopped a robbery, and when she takes off the masks of one of the robbers, she sees it is her teenage self. The girl speaks to Alex on behalf of Kelly and tries to explain to her that none of this is real. Alex again refuses to believe it. The two Alexes find themselves together trapped in a laboratory where her friends and own mother are trying to call her away, insisting something else is wrong and she needs to stay with them. Alex eventually believes younger Alex and willingly recalls herself from the game.

                                                                                                                          After Alex returns to her apartment, she is scared over having not been able to escape and Kelly comforts her. Alex decides to change her mind about not going to her father's funeral. William has spent the entire day tracking down the lists of names of people that have gone missing after putting on the contact lenses. After learning that 100 out of 100 of them have simply been binge existing inside the VR game, he decides to contact a friend in NSR who checks out 402 of the users. He discovers 336 of them are VR geeks, and much to William's disappointment, it doesn't connect to Lex Luthor like he had hoped. However, the list of remaining names are all located at the same address, and unreachable. William immediately goes there but Margot Morrison is able to physically shield everything from him. He leaves empty-handed.

                                                                                                                            Lex has been behind the scenes influencing and manipulating events. He was a conspirator with the alternate Winn Schott when he arrived; he acted as a bartender and talked to Richard Bates; and Lex manipulated Eve Teschmacher so that she would kill Jeremiah Danvers and make it look like a heart attack. Lex has had Brainy to keep him abreast of the D.E.O. and Gemma Cooper to inform him of Leviathan's moves. Even Amy Sapphire unknowingly got her gauntlets from Lex. However, Lex's biggest problem is how to impress Lena, at the request of his mother, that all of the Luthor family should be united, so Lex decides to involve himself with her projects. Lex went around the world to one hundred countries promoting Obsidian Platinum as his chess pieces moved into position. When he returned, he was upset to see Lena being humble before Kara, though she was there to give Kara her condolences on her father's death. He tells Lillian that he will use a Sun-Eater to his advantage. He plots against Leviathan to make them accelerate their project, then has Brainy convince Supergirl to use Myriad, from which Lena is banned. So Lex sends Lena to the Fortress of Solitude to prove her hypocrisy, but he also sends a Morae to get him a sun-eater.

Supergirl has the Morae captured at the Fortress and helped the Martians stop the Sun-eater. Meanwhile, Lex has Margot Morrison killed and her hostages released to gain the trust of Leviathan, so that he can eventually have access to their ship and defeat the immortals; he will not allow humanity to be subjected to them any more. Supergirl and J'onn J'onzz find it hard to believe that Lex is a hero.

While the Martians stop the tremors, Supergirl and Dreamer battle the Jarhanpurian. Upon his defeat, the D.E.O. arrives; this starts an argument about jurisdiction between Brainy and Nia.

The two discover that she was working with Eve Teschmacher; Kelly remembers her from Earth-38 and feels that she is dangerous to Obsidian North and the plans of Andrea Rojas. However, when William and Kelly tell Andrea about their suspicions, they are quickly dismissed since Eve has no record of wrong-doing. At D.E.O. National City headquarters, Dreamer has a bad feeling while Brainy interrogates Rama Khan, so she and Supergirl watch; noting this, Brainy begins to talk to him in his planet's language, so the observers won't understand. Brainy threatens Rama Khan that he will keep him imprisoned unless he gets access to his ship. Rama Khan laughs; he allowed himself to be captured so he could get inside the headquarters. Rama Khan quickly escapes and Supergirl and Dreamer battle him as Brainy evacuates the building.

                                                                                                                              Alex and Andrew find themselves chased by an assassin who was hired to stop their research into Leviathan. They barely escape and Alex feels exposed without the resources and firepower she once had. Kelly suggests that she takes on the mantle of Guardian, like her brother had.
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                              The Martians get involved in the fight against Rama Khan and M'gann is nearly killed. He then continues his assault as he pulls all of the Kryptonite stored in the building to himself. Rama Khan, successful in his quest, destroys the building as a grand exit.
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                              At the prison, Lena ultimately learns that her project is a failure because humanity will do whatever it takes to survive, even evolve and adapt in moments. As she experiments with her Q-wave generator, Lex plays with the prisoners who are trying to hurt them by teleporting with his Transmatter portal. After the inmates are secured, Lex tells Lena that he already did the calculations and knew that Non Nocere was a failure and that she should side with him in leading humanity. Lena is in disbelief, as even in a new world, Lex wants to rule. Lex then lists his sacrifices to bide his time as he worked on this failure.
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                              After Lena leaves, Lex, spitefully, has the prison explode. When Brainy goes to his boss about the destruction of the D.E.O., Lex laughs; Brainy may be a twelfth-level intellect, but Lex knew the Coluan would try to get to the space ship on his own, just another move in the chess game. Lex tells Brainy that he himself got access to the ship through Rama Khan getting the kryptonite.
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                              William follows Eve into an alley; she places a bag on his head and captures him. Scared that he might have lost M'gann in battle, J'onn confesses his feelings and they begin a relationship.

                                                                                                                              Humbly, Lena goes to Kara's apartment and confesses that she was angry about not knowing the Secret identities of the Superfriends and wanted to prove that the world did not need Supergirl. Crying, Lena says that she was slowly becoming a villain and was unknowingly working with Leviathan through Lex; she knows something horrible is on the horizon. Kara stands silent through Lena's speech. When Lena apologizes, Kara asks her friend to take a seat.</div>

When Lex visits the true headquarters of Leviathan, which emits specific radiation that kills all but Jarhanpurians, Rama Khan assures him that he, Sela and Tezumak can handle Supergirl. They know that they can track her wherever she goes or uses her powers.

                                                                                                                                The Superfriends know this, too, and extensively discuss it after they kick in the door to Kara Danvers' apartment thinking that Lena Luthor was a villain. They decide that while Lena makes Supergirl a protective suit, J'onn J'onzz and M'gann M'orzz will impersonate her. The ancient immortals fall for the ruse and attack the Superfriends.

Billions of people place their minds in Obsidian Platinum and become oblivious to reality.

With the help of Lena, whom Kara has angrily reprimanded for her past actions, they find him as a prisoner of Eve Teschmacher, who has little problem with killing him to protect her mother. Supergirl calms the situation but Leviathan attacks, using their Kryptonite. Suddenly, the suit arrives and protects the hero. She causes an explosion that destroys the immortals, but they reintegrate.

Brainy enters the spacecraft base, to his detriment, and begins a program with their computer to defeat the ancients. Supergirl learns from Eve that virtual reality will be humanity's mental graveyard (killing 4/7 of the population) if Lex and Leviathan have their way. so she enters the realm to have people end their simulation. Gamemnae grows tired of Supergirl's interference; she sends Andrea Rojas to deal with her, citing that she has always been Andrea's protector. When Andrea hesitates to follow directions, Gamemnae, having revealed her leadership of the covert organization, threatens that she will assure that Bernardo Rojas will not survive. Andrea, as Acrata and carrying a Kryptonite knife, finds Lena protecting the helpless Supergirl. Lena talks Andrea out of her plans and Supergirl talks billions out of using Obsidian North.

                                                                                                                                The Superfriends begin to lose their battle against the ancient elementals when they suddenly disappear; the dying Brainiac forcibly teleported them and shrunk them into a bottle. Whacked with pain from the radiation, Briany collapses with the bottle. His female doppelganger appears from the Big Brain, congratulating him for succeeding in stopping Leviathan; he won where she failed. Gamemnae, a goddess of technology, is able to resist the trap, through great difficulty and struggle. Lex sees what is occurring and immediate goes to Leviathan's ship. Though angry that Supergirl wasn't killed by Leviathan before they were dealt with, Lex just laughs it off; he's got backup plans for that. He once again laughs at Brainy; Lex calculated for Brainy's betrayal, just not that he would be willing to kill himself for the victory. He takes the bottle and, with the Transmatter portal, goes to see Lillian Luthor. Back at the battlefield, Dreamer has passed out due to her powers forcing her to dream. She sees Brainy inside Leviathan's ship, crying and in pain. She wakes in utter horror, telling M'gann and Alex that Brainy is in trouble. Nia now realizes it was Brainy who saved them and his pushing her away was out of love.

                                                                                                                                In Lena's lab, Lena reveals she got rid of the mercenaries Lex posted to keep Eve's mother hostage. Kara is happy to hear it, with both ready to renew their friendship. Both agree that now Leviathan is no longer around, they have to focus on stopping Lex.

Aware Obsidian failed and her allies have been captured, the goddess of technology screams in rage. Her anger causes the televisions to spark as her human disguise explodes off her, revealing a mechancial-like being.

With a gleeful smile, Lex hands the bottled Leviathan to Lillian. He tells her that they are getting to work. Examining the bottle, Lillian agrees it's time.</div>
