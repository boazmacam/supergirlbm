                          Suddenly, they hear noise from the horse ranch, and it's Oliver and Barry who ran straight to Lois. She is about to strike with a hammer, but Kara speeds there, and breaks the situation, and introduces Oliver ad Barry to Clark and Lois, and vice versa.

Suddenly, A.M.A.Z.O. returns to wreak havoc in Central City.
                          
                          Back on the Kent Farm, Oliver goes to Barry. He concedes the amount he detests seeing Barry be so carefree with his abilities, so as to be The Green Arrow Oliver utilizes the entirety of his history of torment. Barry says that being The Flash for him is the inverse. Relinquishing his torment encourages him. They understand that Oliver is a superior speedster when he is upbeat and Barry is an increasingly gifted warrior when he's distraught, so with Kara's consolation they choose to be progressively similar to one another.
                          
                          Cisco arrives to the farm to be greeted by Oliver, Barry and Kara. He tells them they believe their characters have been switched, and requests their help in defeating A.M.A.Z.O. Clark also joins and reveals himself as Superman to Cisco.
                          
                          By the time the heroes arrive at Earth-1 Central City, A.M.A.Z.O. is already on a rampage. Oliver, Barry and Kara strike at it hard and fast, and eventually Clark swoops down from the sky and strikes the robot to the ground. However, it gets back up and copies all of their powers, and the heroes can't harm it, as it can now phase like the Flash can. Iris asks if Cisco can do anything to stop it, while Cisco denies it, and Sherloque tells them "It's a computer right? So- Just turn it off."
                          
                          Once the countermeasure is ready, Barry then tells Oliver to lure A.M.A.Z.O., as it can't run and phase at the same time. He tells Kara and Clark that they must hold the robot still and Barry will then shoot it with the countermeasure. Cisco arrives with it, and Oliver brings the robot. Kara and Clark grab hold of it, and Oliver grabs on it too to neutralize it's phasing ability. Barry aims at A.M.A.Z.O. and says Oliver's catchphrase, "You have failed this city!", and shoots. it's a direct hit, and A.M.A.Z.O. shuts down.
                          
                          Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry talks with Iris and she reveals she let him and Oliver go, because she felt something when Barry told her the truth. But she wants him to promise that he will come back as himself and not as Oliver. Barry promises. Cisco then reveal to Oliver, Barry and Kara about the vibe he had about the Monitor. Oliver wants to see it, and Cisco vibes with him and Barry. It is seen that the Monitor gave a book to John Deegan, and he could sense Cisco's presence and is amazed that there is someone with Cisco's powers on Earth-1. He claims that the events are already in motion, and that they can't stop what comes and it's better to run. The vibe ends and Cisco bleeds afterwards. Monitor's words didn't make sense, but Oliver quickly draws a picture about the place they were on, and while they don't recognize the men, Oliver recognizes the name of the tower in it: Wayne Tower. This means that they are in Gotham City, and that's where they will be going.

                                                      Meanwhile, J'onn, Brainy and Nia are outside the facility, where captured aliens have been taken. As they try to figure out a way to get inside, Nia suggest they do "The Wookiee Gambit". J'onn disagrees, as it means someone would have to pose as a prisoner. Eventually, they go with it, with Nia posing as a prisoner and Brainy disguising himself as Ben Lockwood. However, they are caught and taken inside. There, they discover a transmat portal. In order to find out, where the aliens are taken, they need to go through. But the Children of Liberty take Brainy away for brutal interrogation, and as a result, they brutally hit him, which causes his system to reboot, installing memories of his ancesters to the forefront of his personality . In this state, he manages to break free and defeat the interrogators, calling himself “Version 5. (Braniac 5 was a historically evil villain) He then uses unethical ways to have J'onn and Nia go through the portal.
                                                      
                                                      Lena has Lillian brought to L-Corp, and attaches a baby Vertullarian (truth-speaker) on her to ensure she will speak truth. To test her, Lena asks her about Lena's first boyfriend, and gets a satisfactory answer. Lena smugly says she would ask Lillian, if she loves her, but claims she already knows the answer. Lillian answers nonetheless, and truthfully says she does. Eventually, Lillian manages to create the necessary device to extract Harun-El.
                                                      
                                                      Kara sneaks in to the D.E.O. as Supergirl to warn Alex about the Red Daughter. She manages to reach her. Kara tells Alex not to pursue Red Daughter for her own safety. Colonel Haley enters the room and when she sees Supergirl, she is shocked and thinks that Alex brought an enemy into the D.E.O. But Alex and Kara convince her, that she didn't attack the White House; it was done by a clone of Supergirl under Lex's control. Kara also reveals Lex has engineered Kaznia to attack America. Haley admits, that she didn't believe Supergirl would attack the White House, and she has also been suspicious about President Baker's erratic decisions. All three then start to put their heads together to try to ascertain, where Red Daughter might be. They conclude she must have been in National City for some time already. Eventually, they track an address in the city. Kara intends to go and check it out. Alex wants to come along, but Kara tells her to remain behind. Haley intends to keep finding information about the Claymore satellite, since she was unaware such a weapon existed.
                                                      
                                                      Kara arrives to to the address, and enters Red Daughter's apartment. She is instantly shocked; although the apartment is in an old building, it has been furnished and decorated to be like an exact copy of Kara's own apartment. Alex also arrives, claiming she couldn't sit idly by. She is even more shocked about the apartment, and looks through the window to see, that Kara's apartment can be seen from there. Alex wonders, why someone would be interested in her sister's apartment. Alex has more flashes of memories. As Kara and Alex look over the place, Kara finds pictures about the Kaznian boy, Mikhail, realizing that Red Daughter cared about him, and that Lex made it look like he was killed by Americans, fueling her hatred. Alex's phone rings. The caller is Eliza, saying that Kara just came by. Kara instantly realizes it's actually Red Daughter and flies to Midvale. Alex follows suit in her motorcycle.
                                                      
                                                      Kara reaches Danvers house in Midvale to find Eliza being held hostage by Red Daughter. Kara tries to reason with her, even saying about Mikhail, but Red Daughter still claims Kara is weak for serving herself, while she is strong, since she serves the collective. Red Daughter activates a similar armor that Kara also has, and the two Kryptonians clash. As Red Daughter taunts her template, Kara sees she really doesn't know her, as she doesn't serve herself, but everyone by giving them hope, help and compassion. Kara also asks her, how does she think this will end, since they have same powers. Red Daughter corrects her by showing she can wield Harun-El-powered electrical shocks. Kara gets an early upper hand in the fight.
                                                      
                                                      The fight continues to the night. Alex finally arrives and hears the fight. Kara has lost her early upper hand, and is now being pummeled by Red Daughter. As Alex watches without interfering, knowing she can't handle Kryptonian on her own, she has a memory flash every time Red Daughter punches Kara. The flashes include: Kara saving her from the cliffs after causing the thunderclap, Kara creating a snowfall inside Danvers house during Christmas, Alex holding her hand on spaceship window, with Kara as Supergirl holding hers against it[1]. After the final blow, Alex's memories return in its entirety, and she remembers again that Kara and Supergirl are one and the same, her beloved adoptive sister. As Red Daughter hovers away after defeating her enemy, she witnesses, as Alex goes to her sister. She hears, as Kara's heartbeat fades, but right after, she hears explosions, and worriedly flies away. Eliza arrives and is saddened to see Kara defeated and seemingly dead. Alex is unwilling to believe her sister is dead, saying all she needs is sunlight to recover. But it's night, so no sunlight. She then rips some grass on Kara's hand, as plants have sunlight within them. At first nothing happens, and Alex is devastated, but then sunlight starts to seep from plants towards Kara. The sunlight re-energizes her, and she is revived. Alex cries out of happiness, and Kara sees Alex has regained her memories, and says she missed Alex so much.
                                                      
                                                      Back at the Danvers House, Alex calls Colonel Haley, and she says the Claymore Kara destroyed was only a prototype. Since then, it has been developed into such that it can be controlled by a Lexosuit. Haley then tells Alex to turn on the news. The news report has President Baker holding a speech towards the heroism of Lex Luthor, about how he stopped a Kaznian invasion. The report closes with Lex carrying seemingly dead Supergirl in his arms, (Although it’s really Red Daughter) with Baker framing Supergirl as the one behind the invasion. Kara is shocked about how this could've happened.</div>

                                                      <h1>Supergirl: Season 4: Episode 22: "The Quest for Peace"</h1>
                                                      <div class="box">24 hours before Kara was defeated by Red Daughter, the latter went back to Lex Luthor, saying 'sorry' for neglecting to kill Supergirl. He tells her to follow Eliza. Six hours before, Lex and Eve are then placing aliens into a battery-like chambers and uses their powers to control his Lexosuit. One hour before Lex and the President are in the Oval Office with the president scrutinizing Lex's sureness and the Kaznian assault starts. But just as Lex planned, he single-handedly stops the Kaznian invasion. Just as Red Daughter defeated Supergirl, she hears explosions, and meets Lex on the beach. She tells Supergirl is dead, but is shocked that Kaznia's attack happened early, as she was supposed to lead it. Lex reveals he did it, and without qualms, shoots down a Kaznian fighter, and seemingly kills a horrified Red Daughter.

                                                        As the news shows a triumphant Lex holding an apparently deceased Red Daughter in his arms, passing her off as Supergirl, Kara tells Eliza and Alex that she needs to show the world the truth about Lex. In an AmerTek energy facility, Lex has Red Daughter put in one of the battery units where he reveals to her how stupid she was to have ever trusted him, as she could've found out the truth about him easily with all the freedom she was provided. Otherwise, she would've learned that he never realistically support Kaznia and most important his undying hatred of Kryptonians. Lex seals Red Daughter into the pod, and she is feeling both betrayed and regretful.
                                                        
                                                        Meanwhile, Ben Lockwood returns to his father's steel mill. Suffering from withdrawal from the Harun-El, he watches President Baker on the television, reporting Otis Graves's passing and supposed manifesto found next to him, taking credit for all of Lex's crimes. As Lockwood readies to inject himself with more Harun-El, Baker fully pardons Lex and names him as the new Director of Alien Affairs. Suddenly, he is ambushed by several masked attackers but he uses superspeed to incapacitate them all. He soon finds his assailants were Eve clones, all whom vanish, save one, whom he then proceeds to interrogate on Lex's plans.
                                                        
                                                        Somewhere else, Nia and J'onn have gone through the entryway and wound up on Shelley Island - where Lex has a greater amount of the batteries. At Lena's office, a still aloof Brainy uncovers what's new with Nia and J'onn. Kara and Alex arrive, and Brainy tells Kara he has already reacquired the evidence Secret Service erased. Kara then begins writing an exposé about Lex and his scheme and everyone involved in it. Lena receives an invitation from Lex to the White House. Lena wasn't the only one to have received the invitation; Lillian did as well. Lex uncovers his arrangement to Lena and his mom: he's outfitting the forces of the aliens to utilize them as rechargable dispensable batteries to control the world. He likewise plans to utilize the main bunch of batteries to power up a new Claymore to assault and crush Argo City and hence, Superman. Eve pulls Lex away, and criticizes Lex for wasting energy on Superman. Lex disregards her, as his burning hatred towards his arch-nemesis can't be quenched. In Shelley Island, Al approaches J'onn and Nia and is ready to provide a distraction, so that J'onn and Nia can power down the island's power dampening pylons.

                                                        Kara finishes the article, and Alex is proud of it, even claiming it could win a Pulitzer. The article is transmitted to everyone in the country, and the truth about Lex's scheme becomes public knowledge. J'onn , Nia and Al start up a fight, allowing Nia and J'onn to disable the pylons. Nia then astral projects to Lena's office, but since nobody can see or hear her, Brainy has her write the answer on water vapor on the window. Kara and Alex go get James and head to the island along with Brainy.
                                                        
                                                        As the heroes land on the island, Brainy learns the place has been transformed into an energy plant, where the power extracted from aliens is being used to power up a new Claymore, that is targeting Argo City. Suddenly, they are ambushed by Ben Lockwood and his Children of Liberty, who desire revenge against Lex for being his pawns and also kill every alien they can find, and fight starts. However, the Children are no match against Superfriends, even with Ben's Harun-El powers. Inside the facility, J'onn and Nia find the core, but they can't shut it down. Brainy arrives and claims the Claymore will fire soon. J'onn, however, intends to use his psychic powers to overload the core, claiming he won't let what happened to Mars happen again, despite Brainy's warning he will likely die. Nia chooses to help him by using her powers as well. As they charge up the core, Brainy's emotions start to return, and he encourages the two to go for it and admits he loves Nia. They succeed, and the core is powered down.
                                                        
                                                        In the White House, Lex has outsmarted Lillian's poisoning attempt and the Claymore is almost ready to fire. But when the cannon doesn't fire, he angrily calls Eve, and she tells him there's a situation on Shelley Island. He immediately powers up his Lexosuit and flies there.
                                                        
                                                        Kara, Alex and James are still fighting Lockwood, when suddenly, Lex arrives. James tells Kara to go, and she fights Lex. They crash inside, and Lex is shocked to see Kara alive. Lex is armed with Kryptonite, but Kara came prepared and activates Lena's armor, that can shield her from Kryptonite. Elsewhere, J'onn, Nia and Brainy free the aliens, and James and Ben manage to extract the Harun-El from each other, and Alex beats Lockwood to the ground. However, James lost an eye. J'onn, Nia and Brainy lead the aliens out. Among them is Red Daughter, who overhears Kara fighting Lex, and flies away. The power on Kara's armor starts to wear out, and Lex shoots her with a lethal blast of Kryptonite, only for Red Daughter to fly in between and take the blast instead. Both Kryptonians are blasted through wall, and Kara crawls to dying Red Daughter, saddened. Red Daughter, having grown fond of her template, says Kara was right about Lex, and encourages her to protect her people, as she protected hers. As Red Daughter dies, she merges with Kara, giving Kara a supercharge that allows her to defeat Lex easily, avenging Red Daughter as well. As Lex tries to escape by flying, his Lexosuit breaks. Kara flies, and begs Lex to let her save him, but due to his pride, Lex would rather die than be saved by a Kryptonian, and falls to the ground, exploding. The rescued aliens cheer at Supergirl, for saving the day.
                                                        
                                                        However, Lex didn't die in the explosion. He ended up in his secret lab, where Lena ambushes him, having figured it out. She extracts the Harun-El from him, and pulls out a gun. Lex claims she isn't ruthless enough to kill him, no matter how much she despises him. But Lena surprises him by shooting him. He is surprised, but before he dies, he shows Lena a video, which proves to Lena that her best friend Kara is Supergirl, and how all her friends have lied to her, even Lillian. Lex dies, but he is happy, as he dies knowing he was not a fool.
                                                        
                                                        At CatCo, the news show that after Kara's article was published, President Baker was removed from office by the 25th amendment, due to him working with Lex, and that the new president has re-enacted the Alien Amnesty Act. Red Daughter's identity was also revealed, clearing Supergirl's name, and Colonel Haley has been appointed as the acting Secretary of Alien Affairs, and openly thanks Supergirl for her service. Kara and Nia admit that for a while, it seemed that truth won't prevail, but they didn't give up, and the battle was won.
                                                        
                                                        Later, Alex is walking with Kelly, and she claims that being close to Alex has made her feel whole, and Alex kisses her. They are passed by by Nia and Brainy, who have begun dating. The next evening all of the Superfriends have gathered for a game night at J'onn's place, finally able to relax after the ordeals. Lena arrives, and it seems she is okay, despite learning the truth about Kara. Kara and Alex discuss about Lena, and Kara intends to tell her she is Supergirl, but Alex advises her to let Lena enjoy the night, after so much pain. The next day, George Lockwood is holding a press conference, where he intends to be a voice between the humans and aliens peaceful co-existence, with Nia being one of the reporters. He says that he has seen first hand, what hatred towards aliens has done to his family. Ben Lockwood has been incarcerated, and as he watches the news report, he is visibly shocked, how his son has totally rejected him. From the distance, Supergirl looks at George and smiles. Lena is drinking in her office, and she smashes her picture of herself, Kara and Alex with the glass, showing she has succumbed to hatred for Kara having lied to her for years. Elsewhere, Eve is trying to hide in a disguise, but she is met by an old woman, who tells her, that they will always be watching her. Eve claims she did everything they wanted, but the old woman says that's not how her organization, Leviathan, works, and says they are everywhere.

                                                        Elsewhere, a portal opens, and a hooded figure emerges. He meets with Mar Novu, who says he was the one, who brought him here, so that he can back get at his brother, who betrayed him. The figure takes off his hood: he is revealed to be a Green Martian, and says he is coming for J'onn J'onzz. Finally, Mar Novu goes to Lex's lab, and does something to Lex's corpse.</div>
