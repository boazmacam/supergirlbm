        <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 1: "Pilot"</h1>
        <div class="box">On the planet of Krypton before its impending destruction, Jor-El and his wife held their only son Kal-El which they later set in a pod on a course set to Earth. Following in suit, Jor-El's brother Zor-El, prepared a pod for his own daughter, Kara Zor-El, telling her that her pod's coordinates were locked with Kal-El's, and she would follow him to Earth. Reassuring her father that she wasn't afraid, Kara was told by her mother that they'd be with her in her dreams, and on Earth, she'd have amazing abilities due to the Earth's yellow sun, promising her that she'd do extraordinary things. Boarding her pod, Kara's pod rocketed after Kal-El's, with Krypton self destructing seconds later. However shock waves from Krypton's destruction pushed Kara's pod into the Phantom Zone, a region of space where time didn't pass. Sleeping there for over twenty four years, Kara's pod was later able to get loose. Arriving on Earth, still a thirteen-year-old girl, her pod was discovered by a then-adult Kal-El, who had gone on to become the famous hero known as Superman, the most powerful man in the universe. Wanting her to have a similar upbringing to his own, Kal-El placed Kara with the Danvers family, scientists who once helped him understand his own superhuman abilities. Though she wasn't her mother, Kara was reassured by Eliza Danvers that she was safe with them. Kara decided the best thing she could do was fit in, as Earth didn't need another hero. Kara went to work at CatCo Worldwide Media as the personal assistant of Cat Grant, the most powerful woman in National City. Ordering two tickets for the Orchestra section of Wicked, Kara explained on the phone that they weren't for Grant, rather Grant's mother who wanted to see it again. Being put on hold, Kara went on to talk to call about the correspondents dinner, making sure that Cat Grant wasn't seated next to Bill O'Reily again. Walking in the CatCo Worldwide Media building, Kara was asked by Winn Schott whether she had seen the report about an armored car robbery, with a homeless guy swearing that the perpetrator had horns. Continuing by trying to convince Kara that aliens existed, she shot back by telling him they didn't, with Winn claiming she'd feel different if she read the website he read the reports from, though Kara pointed out he was the one wrote the website. Changing the subject, Winn asked Kara whether or not she'd want to go see a movie that night, Kara apologetically rejected his offer as she had a date that night. Going on to ask who she was going out with, Winn was told by Kara that it was an online date, telling her that her and her date were eighty two percent compatible. Arguing that emotions couldn't be quantified by an algorithm, Kara asked Winn since he was in the IT department, whether or not his entire life was based upon algorithms. Agreeing that yes, his entire life was based upon algorithms, Winn pointed out that as such, he'd know if there was one for love, and that Kara would know when she was in love. Using her super-hearing, Kara heard Cat Grant coming up through her private elevator, complaining about the smell, comparing it to standing up in coach. Alerting the room that Grant had arrived, Kara greeted her boss, being told by Grant that the only reason she had bought the building was because of the private elevator, not wanting to be soaked in cheap cologne on her way to her office every morning, telling Kara to find out who had used it, and have them reprimanded or bathed. Giving Cat her latte, Kara was told by Grant that as she had a meeting with the board that day, to cancel sushi with her mother, and her therapy session, as she wouldn't need the session if she wasn't having sushi with her mother. Continuing on, Grant told Kara to prepare termination letters for several tribune employees as she was downsizing the tribune, also telling her to go see if the new art director had the layout ready. Concerned about what would happen to the terminated employees and their families, Kara brought up the point that the Daily Planet didn't have to downsize, though Grant pointed out that Metropolis had Superman, who flew around performing heroic acts, and that the Daily Planet put him on their cover half of the time. Finishing by telling Kara that if she wanted to save the tribune, to go find Grant a hero. Going to get the new layouts, Kara pointed out to the new art director that Cat Grant didn't like to wait, with the art director telling her that Grant could wait a minute. Asking him whether or not he had met Cat Grant, he redirected the question by asking Kara, whether or not Grant would fire him, right after hiring, as it'd be her loss. Turning around, the art director greeted her, with Kara later discovering him to be James Olsen, a photographer from the Daily Planet, after seeing the first photo ever taken of Superman in his office, which he had won a Pulitzer for. Kara later asked her foster sister Alex over to her apartment as she needed help choosing what to wear for her date that night, she expressed to the latter that she felt as if she wasn't living up to her potential. After her failed date later that night, Kara saw on the news that Flight 237, the one Alex was flying on to go to her conference in Geneva, was going down. Attempting to save the flight, Kara used her abilities for the first time in years, successfully helping the plane land, though not without causing damage to Otto Binder Bridge. Kara was later berated at her apartment by Alex, who was upset that she had revealed herself to the world, and couldn't take it back. Deciding to become a hero, Kara confided her secret in Winn the next the day, on the roof of CatCo. At a diner, Vartox watched the news of mysterious woman who had saved Flight 237, angrily walking to his truck, and getting into the back, he was asked by The Commander as to why the DEO operatives weren't dead. Explaining that they had been saved, the two questioned her identity, with Vartox putting together that if Jor-El had saved his own child, Alura might have potentially done the same. Being told by The Commander to eliminate her, Vartox agreed to do so, though telling him that he couldn't promise her death wouldn't be public and messy. With Winn's help, a costume was made, and Kara was able to stop a bank robbery and car chase. Though Kara soon followed by trying to put out a fire that was started, she was captured by the Department of Extra-Normal Operations, using Kryptonite to subdue her. Waking up at their base, she was introduced to Hank Henshaw, the organization's director, and soon discovered that Alex was an agent for the organization as well. After being released, Kara was explained by Henshaw how her ship brought Fort Rozz to Earth, and released thousands of the galaxy's worst criminals. Although she offered to help capture them, her offer was rejected by Henshaw, telling her that if she wanted to help, she could go back to getting someone's coffee. Attempting to leave, Kara was stopped by Alex who tried to apologize, though Kara was angry as Alex had constantly tried to discourage her from using her abilities in the past, finding it strange how Alex's organization hunted aliens, and Kara happened to be one, leading her to believe that Alex was hired because of her. The next day at work, Kara furiously stormed into Cat Grant's office, upset that her boss had dubbed her heroic identity, Supergirl. Almost getting fired in the process, Kara was rescued by James, who presented Grant with a clear image of Supergirl, from the bank robbery she stopped, telling Cat that Kara had gotten it for them. Leaving her office, Kara told James that she didn't need anyone fighting her battles for her, however, at the exact moment she was contacted by Vartox at a 50,000 Hz broadcast, telling her to meet him at the National City Power Plant. Arriving at the power plant, Kara battled Vartox but was eventually defeated before she was rescued by Alex and the DEO, with Vartox escaping. She was taken back to the DEO base where a piece of metal from Vartox's axe was removed from her arm. Afterwards Alex explained to her that she was trying to protect her, as the only way the Fort Rozz escapees could now get back at Alura, who was their judge, was through Kara. Going back to her apartment, she was encouraged by Alex to give being a hero another try, as the world needed her. Though Kara was initially discouraged, after seeing a hologram projection of her mother that Alex had brought, Kara and Alex went back to the DEO base. Learning that Vartox was heading to the city to begin killing humans, Kara convinced Director Henshaw to let her stop him as she had started all of it. Landing in front of his truck, making it explode on impact, Vartox initially had the upper-hand, though Kara was able to subdue him, heating his axe to such levels that made it explode, crippling him. Using a piece of metal from the shattered axe, Vartox committed suicide by stabbing himself in the chest after warning Kara that the true threat was incoming. The following day at work Kara was once more greeted by Winn, who had read about her fight with Vartox in the desert, with Kara promising to tell him all about it on their next crime fighting meetup. Deciding to ask James to lunch, he told her that she must be hungry as fighting Vartox must have burned calories, following by telling her to meet him on the roof. There he revealed to Kara that Superman had asked him to come to National City, as Superman had asked him to come there to keep an eye on her. Realizing that her cousin had wanted her to become a hero, Kara was confused as to why he didn't just tell her himself, with James revealing to her that Superman wanted her to choose it for herself, the same way he had to, as that was what made a hero. Kara was then given the blanket Kal-El was wrapped in as a baby, that James had been entrusted to give to Kara for her to use as a cape. elsewhere, The Commander met with The General who gave him orders to find and kill Kara, as no one could interfere with their plans, not even Kara, who was the General's niece.</div>

        <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 2: "Stronger Together"</h1>
        <div class="box">A week after revealing herself to National City, Supergirl's abilities were put to the test by Hank Henshaw and the D.E.O.. While flying, Kara complained to Henshaw over a head set whether or not the tests were mandatory for everyone, or just because she was an alien. Thinking she was going to say because she was a woman, Hank explained to her that the tests were mandatory for all prospective field agents. Continuing on, Hank told her that a new superhero could in fact be a liability and as such he needed to know if she was in full control of her powers. After breaking the sound barrier, simultaneously a glass board when flying past the DEO camp, Henshaw ordered for two more missiles to be fired at Supergirl. Kara successfully evaded the missiles, making the two bump into each other and explode. Landing at the DEO camp, Kara asked Henshaw whether she passed, though he noted that she shared Superman's appetite for wanton destruction. After talking to Henshaw, Kara asked her sister, Alex Danvers, whether all of the tests were necessary as she felt that she was ready for all of it. Alex told Kara that whether she believed it or not, Henshaw was simply looking out for her, and that she had gone through a full year of training before being let out into the field. Sighing, Alex expressed to Kara that she was really glad she was there, and that she hated keeping the DEO aspect of her life from Kara. Soon after, Kara was contacted by Winn Schott over her earpiece, being alerted to a huge fire occurring at the National City Port. Telling Winn that she was on her way, Kara was warned by Alex that she had been pushing her endurance for the past two hours, and that even she had her limits. However, Kara told Alex that for the past twelve years she had hid who she was, and seeing as she didn't have to anymore, she didn't want to waste a minute of it. At the National City Port, Kara asked the fire chief what could she do to help. He explained to her that the ship near the Port was holding a million barrels of crude oil, and if the fire reached it, it'd explode. Attempting to cease the fire by using her super breath, a firefighter complained that Supergirl was making the fire worse. Choosing to try another method, Kara unattached the ship from the Port using her heat vision, and pulled the ship away from the Port by its hull. However, while doing so, Kara ripped open the Hull releasing oil into the bay. The next day at CatCo Worldwide Media, Kara walked out of the elevator being met by Winn, who asked whether the smell was coming from her. Kara explained to Winn that even after three showers she still smelled of burning oil, expressing that she went from superhero to an eco-terrorist after the previous day's failed heroics. Attempting to comfort her, Winn pointed out that she was only a week into being a superhero, and that she was going to make mistakes. Turning their heads to the news, the two watched Maxwell Lord on television explaining that Supergirl would bring trouble to National City that it didn't need, and using Metropolis as an example, brought up that since Superman's arrival, Metropolis' maintenance budget had quadrupled, as a super bad guy war had been waged on the city. Though Winn told Kara who cared what Maxwell Lord thought, Kara pointed that Winn did, asking wasn't Lord was his personal hero, which in turn forced Winn to admit to owning several of Lord's watches, and both his biography and auto-biography. Using her super hearing, Kara alerted Winn that Cat Grant had arrived, with Winn commenting on how he finally knew how she able to know that. Heating up Cat's latte with her heat vision, Kara met Grant outside her private elevator, giving her the latte, and was informed that content meeting was taking place in her office in two minutes. In her office, Cat told everyone that she assumed they were all aware of Supergirl's latest heroic failure. Cat informed everyone that it was the lead story on the Daily Planet homepage, their fifth in as many days, and it annoyed her, because they already had a go to superhero and they were trying to steal hers. Continuing on, Grant made it known that when she branded Supergirl, there was an implicit promise that she'd at least be above average, and that in the past week she had proved herself to be the very opposite of super. This however, caused James Olsen to comment that Superman had made many mistakes when he himself had first started out, and that at least Supergirl was saving lives. Cat pointed out that she was doing so in the sloppiest way possible, and that it was up to them to save Supergirl from ruining her image, to take control of the heroine's narrative, and scoop the Daily Planet. Cat then announced that she wanted an interview with Supergirl. Snickering because of this, Kara told Cat it was because of a kitten video that she had seen earlier. Cat then asked James whether or not he could asked Superman to arrange an interview with Supergirl the next time they hanged out, though James told her that wasn't the way things worked. Finishing, Cat told the attendees of the meeting that Clark Kent, Lois Lane, and the rest of the Daily Planet employees were working day and night to get an exclusive with Supergirl, though they needed to get it first, with Cat wanting an interview with Supergirl by the end of the week. After telling everyone they could leave, Cat stopped Kara before she could do so as well, telling her assistant that she knew what was going on with her, and that she needed to get her head out of the clouds, whether that meant joining a gym or seeing a shrink, she needed to get her head back behind the desk where it belonged. Leaving Cat's office, Kara refused to do the interview with Grant, as she thought that Cat would recognize her within seconds. James however shot back that Cat wouldn't recognize her as Supergirl, because she didn't even see her now. Recalling that he watched it happen for years with her cousin, James reassured Kara, giving her a pep-talk after she doubted herself, telling him that she might have become a superhero too soon. At Plastino Chemicals, two guards talked about the arrival of Supergirl to National City, with one commenting on how it was nice that National City now had its own hero, and with the other retorting that the other guard had said the same exact thing when they had gotten their own professional basketball team. Walking into the building and going their separate ways, the guard caught a man filling a tank with chemicals. Asking the man whether or not everything was okay there, he was told that everything was fine, and that the man was just finishing up. Right after, the guard asked to see his ID, taking out his gun and asking the man to stand back from the tank, reporting on his radio that there was a sector breach in Sector 52. The man soon revealed his true form, causing the guard to run in fear. However, the guard was caught by the man who scaled the walls chasing after him, eventually landing on him and catching him. The next day, the DEO investigated the theft and murder of the guard, with Alex Danvers calling Supergirl to assist. When asked by Henshaw as to why she did so, Alex explained to him that as they hunted aliens, and Kara was one, she was a resource that they hadn't had before hand. Asking what she could do to help, Kara was told by Henshaw to look around, though to not touch anything. He then went on to tell Alex that Plastino Chemicals specialized in chemical manufacturing, including ingredients for a chemical bomb, and as such they needed to find the alien fast. Years ago on Krypton, Alura Zor-El walked into Kara's room, questioning as to why she was still up. After telling her mother that she simply wanted to see her, Kara asked Alura why she had been working so late, and was told by the latter that a Hellgrammite criminal had been brought to the citadel. Kara told Alura that one day she wanted to help people just like she did, and Alura told her that she would as she had the heart of a hero. While at the DEO base, Kara remembered this, also remembering that her mother had sent one to Fort Rozz (prison), with Alex noting that from the wreckage they salvaged from the Fort Rozz (prison) (prison) crash, there had in fact been a Hellgrammite prisoner. Kara attempted to offer to Henshaw that the DEO could track the Hellgrammite down, and she'd defeat him as they did with Vartox, though Henshaw came to the conclusion that they would only do so if she could prove to them that she could handle herself without being killed. Going into the DEO training room, Kara was defeated by Alex after Kryptonite emitters were turned on in the room, weakening Kara, though making it a fair fight. After Kara left with the sentiment that she know knew why Superman preferred to work alone, Alex told Henshaw that she hated that he had made her do that. At CatCo the next day, Cat asked Kara why she was walking strange, with Kara excusing it as having had took a kickboxing class, and as such was sore. Kara soon read the latest headline written by Cat, and asked her boss why she was intent on criticizing Supergirl when she was trying to save the city. Cat explained to Kara that Supergirl had been taking on too much too early, that there was a learning curve, and that Supergirl needed to start small and work her way up. Leaving Cat's office, Kara told Winn to meet her in the alley in five minutes. Walking out into the alley, Winn encountered James, and after the two attempted to get each other to leave as they were both meeting someone there, they were surprised to find out that both of them were confidants of Kara, and each knew her identity as Supergirl when she landed in front of them. After their initial surprise, Kara told the two that if she was going to be a hero, she'd need to practice and needed their help, with the both of them telling her that they were in. At a warehouse, the Hellgrammite was confronted by two Kryptonian underlings of General Astra. The Hellgrammiate attempted to explain to the two that he didn't want any trouble and he had to eat. Commander Gor however told him that if he didn't want any trouble he would have stayed hidden, and reminded the Hellgrammite that Astra had promised to take care of all of their needs on Earth in exchange for his loyalty. He was soon confronted by Astra herself, who told him that they were stronger together and he'd help her capture her niece, Supergirl, acting as a bait. When the Hellgrammite attempted to decline, Astra made it clear that it was a command and not an invitation. Meanwhile, Kara asked what jobs James and Winn had for her. The two alerted her of several of emergencies, with Kara preventing a pizza place from being robbed, rescuing an ambulance stuck in traffic, and saving a young girl's snake from a tree. Later at her apartment, Kara watched the news with Winn and James, excitedly telling the two that people were starting to believe in Supergirl. James corrected her, by telling Kara that they were starting to believe in her, and Kara thanked James for his help, expressing that she couldn't have done it without him. Kara soon answered her apartment door for Alex, and was later questioned by her sister as to whether telling James and Winn her secret identity was a good idea. Kara expressed that it was a good idea as they were her friends, and soon after received an apology from Alex, who regretted how she handled things at the DEO. However, Alex was soon called by the DEO who needed her back at the base, telling Kara that she'd call her. At the DEO, Alex asked what the news on the Hellgrammite prisoner was, and was told by Henshaw that they had confirmed six similar attacks on chemical plants across the country within the past year. The two were soon alerted by Agent Hartmann that the Hellgrammite's blood wasn't carbon based like human's, but instead had a chlorine foundation. Alex then brought up the fact that each of the facilities that had been hit stored confiscated DDT, and that the Hellgrammite was eating it, as the government had been destroying remaining stockpiles, and his food source was shrinking. At CatCo, James was summoned by Cat wanting to know if he had made any progress on getting any interview with Supergirl. James however told her that since Supergirl was in fact doing better, he wasn't sure if Cat was still interested in controlling her narrative. The two continued to discuss the situation, with James telling Cat that he had a policy of using his friends for business purposes. Cat however gave James the dilemma of getting her the interview within twenty four hours, or else he'd be fired. Elsewhere in National City, the DEO set a trap for the Hellgrammite with a truck driving with tanks of DDT in its back, and Alex and Henshaw along with several other DEO agents following behind it in another vehicle. The Hellgrammite soon arrived, jumping onto the vehicle with the DDT. After being shot at by Henshaw and Alex, the Hellgrammite jumped onto their vehicle, shooting stingers into several of the agents and abducting Alex, grabbing her and taking her back to General Astra. Outside of CatCo, Kara offered to do the interview with Cat Grant so James wouldn't be fired, he then revealed to her that things such as that had been happening for a while, and he thought coming to National City he could finally be his own man. Kara told him that on Krypton no one was their own man, and that it was an honor to accept help from others, and that apart of being his own man was knowing when to accept help from others. She then re-iterated that she was going to do the interview with Cat, though not for James solely, but for what they were accomplishing together. Kara then received a call from Henshaw who told her that Alex had been abducted. At the DEO base, Kara berated Henshaw for putting her through tests instead of trusting her, as the situation could have been prevented if Kara had been there. Henshaw however reassured Kara that they had every satellite and a tactical drone searching for Alex, though Kara told him that they had her now as well. Flying through National City, Kara attempted to use her super hearing to track down Alex. At the warehouse, Astra commented on Alex's wounds, and how fragile human beings were. Mistaking Astra for Alura, Alex told the General that she had seen her in the message from the ship that had brought Kara to Earth. Astra revealed her true identity to Alex, and after being told by the latter that there wasn't a reason to kill her or anyone in National City, Astra told her that she was there to save them all. Kara soon tracked Alex down with her super hearing, alerting Henshaw to Alex's location, which was at a warehouse on the corner of 78th and Washington. Henshaw alerted the other DEO agents to get together a strike team, as they were moving out. Arriving at the warehouse, Kara walked towards Alex, though was warned by the latter that it was a trap and to get out of there. Turning around, Kara was punched into the ground by Astra, who had remarked that it had been a long time since the two had seen each other. Getting up, Kara couldn't believe that her aunt was still alive, as she had thought Astra had died on Krypton. However, Astra revealed to Kara that she had been imprisoned by Alura in Fort Rozz (prison), and wasn't on Krypton when it exploded. Astra warned Kara not to stand against her, and a fight between the two ensued. While attempting to contact the DEO through her radio, Alex was thrown into a chain-link fence by the Hellgrammite, though defeated him by forcing his own stinger into his heart. During her fight with Astra, Kara remembered what Alex had said about using an opponent's strength against them during a fight during their training session, and through Astra out the warehouse, through a window. Alex and Kara embraced afterwards, but were blown down by Astra's super breath. The two were then rescued by Henshaw who commanded Astra to halt. Though Astra grabbed Henshaw by the neck, taunting that he had no weapon that could hurt her, he plunged a Kryptonite knife into her arm, prompting her to fly off. Later at the DEO base, Kara asked Alex to train her, with Alex promising to make Kara better than herself. Alex then took Kara to a room that had been set up for her, inside containing an artificial intelligence program that appeared in the form of Alura. Leaving Kara and the AI to talk, Kara asked for a hug. The AI however hadn't been programmed to do such a thing, so instead Kara asked for the AI to tell her about Astra. Outside of the room, Alex thanked Henshaw for helping her set up the room for Kara, with Henshaw telling her that it was the least he could do for Supergirl. At her base, Astra had the Kryptonite dagger pulled out of her arm. She then questioned her associate as to how the weapon could hurt her as Kryptonians were nearly indestructible on Earth. After telling him to get the blade away from her, Astra's associate told her that they'd have to re-think their timetable for taking National City as the humans were more resourceful then they'd originally thought. Getting into her car, Cat Grant called James Olsen, telling him that even though she had given him twenty four hours, if he hadn't gotten her the interview with Supergirl already, she wanted to setup interviews with new art directors the next day. However, James informed her that her interview with Supergirl had already begun, telling her to look out her window. Doing so, Cat realized that her car was being carried by Supergirl. After the car was put down, Cat got out, and was told by Supergirl that James Olsen had told her that Cat wanted to talk to her.</div>

        <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 3: "Fight or Flight"</h1>
        <div class="box">Supergirl starts her interview with Cat Grant, during which the latter questions her about her origin, powers, and whereabouts, all while recording the interview. Eventually, Kara became frustrated because she felt that no one asked Superman the type of questions that Cat was asking her, and she accidentally reveals that she and Superman are in fact cousins. After doing so, she promptly ends the interview, flying off. The next morning, Kara ate sticky buns at a cafe, with her server questioning as to how Kara could eat sticky buns for breakfast every morning, and stay as thin as she was. She was soon joined by Alex, who teased her that she liked James Olsen, after seeing how Kara had looked at him after he had stopped at their table after getting his tea. Alex emphasized to Kara that she had to stop telling people her identity as Supergirl, as the fewer people who knew, the better.
          At CatCo Worldwide Media, Winn Schott commented on Kara revealing her relationship to Superman after the latter arrived. In an attempt to defend herself, Kara tries to argue that Grant tricked her into revealing it as she didn't mean to, before being called away by Cat herself. Walking into Cat's office, Grant announced to Kara that it was a big day for journalism, and that she had scooped the Daily Planet with revealing Supergirl and Superman's relationship. Kara however attempted to tell Cat that Supergirl might have wanted her familial connection to Superman publicly known, though to no avail. Soon after, Cat told Kara that she would be writing an expose on Supergirl for a special issue of their monthly magazine, and as such she would need bulletproof coffee, a type of coffee that improved brain energy. Finishing, Cat announced that they'd be having a big party to launch the magazine with around 1,000 guests, and she ordered Kara to move Dave to another desk, as she found his hair distracting.
          At the D.E.O. headquarters, Kara was berated by Hank Henshaw for doing the interview with Cat Grant. Afterwards, she was question by Alex as to why she did in the interview, with Kara explaining that although at first she was doing it for James, she did it for her as well, because she thought interviewing with Cat Grant would give her perspective on what being Supergirl meant. Both Kara and Alex were alerted to Agent Vasquez reporting to Henshaw about a multiple car collision on the highway. Attempting to finish his warning about giving interviews to Kara, Hank turned to find that she already had left, with Alex explaining that she was excited as it was her first car pile up. At the highway pile up, Kara landed at the scene with an injured passenger telling her that the bus driver was still inside trapped. Flying over to the bus, Kara rescued the bus driver, placing her on a nearby gurney. While being thanked by the driver, Kara was blasted backwards by a flying figure. After getting up, Kara questioned him as to his identity, with the man commenting that he was a ghost, and that he wanted Superman to suffer and lose everything, starting with Kara. After a brief battle between the two, the man flew away after his suit was damaged by Kara.
          Back at the D.E.O. headquarters, Henshaw identified the man as Reactron, a villain who was at large after several public fights with Superman in the past. Kara asked Henshaw how exactly they were going to stop him, she was told by Henshaw that the D.E.O. wasn't going to help her, as Reactron was human, and as such fell out of their jurisdiction. Though she tried to argue that he could fly and shoot nuclear blasts, Alex told Kara that Reactron had simply been using bio-medical technology, which was man made. Hank finished by telling Kara that he couldn't risk exposing the D.E.O.'s existence as such, and that she should call Superman if she wanted to stop him.
          At CatCo, Kara walked into Cat Grant's office, as she was putting the finishing touches on the party and needed Cat's okay on a few things. Changing the subject, Cat told Kara to have maintenance take a look at the vents, as they were emitting an incessant humming that was disrupting Cat's train of thought while she was trying to write her expose on Supergirl. Kara agreed to have them look at it, before bringing up that she needed Cat to sign off on the appetizers for tomorrow night's party. After Cat made it clear that Kara was at that point disrupting her work, Kara announced that she'd take care of it herself. Leaving the office, James questioned Kara as to whether Cat was always that tense while writing, with Kara explaining that she was. The two were then called by Winn, who told them to follow him and act natural. The three then took the elevator to Ed Flaherty's old office, with Winn explaining that since the latter had died from a heart attack behind his desk, no one wanted it, making it perfect for their base involving Supergirl related matters.
          Finishing, Winn explained that he had setup the office with state of the art technology, and after being thanked by Kara, Winn moved on to the subject of Reactron. The three went over Reactron's powers and his history with Superman, with Winn telling James and Kara that he had written an algorithm that would sweep the city for any changes in radiation to potentially track down Reactron. James questioned Winn as to what they'd if they in fact found Reactron, suggesting that Kara call Superman on this particular case, as he had almost killed Superman in the past. However, Kara argued that if she did so, National City would become an easy target to every villain. She further elaborated that she was going to be defined not as Superman's cousins, but by her victories and losses, and no one elses. Meanwhile, at Lord Technologies, Maxwell Lord fired an employee after he argued with him over increasing the speed to the train the company was working on. While talking with the rest of his employees, Lord was interrupted by Reactron who was seeking out someone with a background in nuclear fission. Though he attempted to abduct Carl, Lord offered himself instead.
          24 hours later at CatCo, Kara and Winn watched KPJT News' report of Lord's abduction. Though Winn tried to convince Kara that it wasn't her fault, Kara told him that she had to find Maxwell Lord, though had no clue how to do so. At the same time Alex arrived offering her help, prompting the three to go down to the base Winn had setup for Supergirl operations. There, the group soon deduced the identity of Reactron, who was in fact Ben Krull, a reactor engineer of Bakerline Nuclear Power Station. Though he and his wife were thought to be dead from an attack on the Power Station by terrorists, Ben had survived the radiation, carrying a vendetta against Superman for the death of his wife. Elsewhere at the junkyard, Maxwell Lord offered to take Ben Krull back to his lab so that his team could analyze Ben's case, and he could regain a normal life. However, Ben rejected the offer and went on to order Lord to fix his suit, or the people of National City would be building memorials to him.
          In Cat's office, Kara reads the article that Grant wrote about Supergirl, and is surprised to find out that Cat insulted her. Later that afternoon Kara discovers the location of Reactron's hideout and races there upon learning that he has Maxwell. When she arrives, Kara saves Maxwell but Reactron is still fixated on Supergirl and uses his powers to weaken her, but just as she loses consciousness, she is saved by her cousin Superman. The following day, Kara discovers that Supergirl is now being discredited by Lord in the media because of Superman, and when she discovers that James called Clark Kent with a device to help her, Kara asks James to leave. Back at the DEO, Hank whose eyes start glowing red, as he grew suspicious, asks Alex if there were others who knew about Kara by using DEO information. Alex says no, as she tries to find out more about Reactron and how to defeat him.
          Later that night at the party that Cat organized in celebrating the Supergirl article, Cat is greeted by Maxwell but his fails in getting Cat to reveal her story, while Kara shares a dance with Winn. James decided to patch things up by also dancing with Kara, but before they can finish the conservation Reactron breaks in and terrorizes everything around him in searching for Supergirl. He then sees Maxwell but before he can kill him, Supergirl arrived and stops him, allowing James to divert Reactron's attention towards him. Kara learns from Alex that removing his power core (his chest plate) will render him powerless but to prevent it melting down immediately it needs to be covered in lead. Kara then melts part of a lead statue onto her hand and heads outside to battle Reactron, where she successfully removes the power core and stops him, saving James.
          Afterwards, Kara thanks Alex and Hank for their help. Back at Kara's apartment, Kara and Alex make up, with Alex suggesting that Kara asks James out. However, when Kara goes to CatCo Worldwide Media, going into his office, Kara sees Lucy Lane, James' ex-girlfriend, who arrived to talk to him. Kara overhears that conversation, leading her to believe that Lucy wants to get back with James. While Kara was upset about this, even giving Winn the cold shoulder, she does receive a texted apology from Clark. Alex also reads the article on Supergirl, telling Kara that Cat was impressed before she took off to answer a siren's sound.</div>

        <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 4: "Livewire"</h1>
        <div class="box">At the D.E.O. headquarters an alien convict escaped its restraints, and went on a rampage throughout the D.E.O. Supergirl arrived, battling the alien alongside several D.E.O. agents, and was eventually able to subdue it. Afterwards she asked Hank Henshaw for the day off, flying back to her apartment to meet with Alex Danvers who she promised she would be there when Alex's mother, Eliza Danvers arrived. Though Kara attempted to reassure Alex, the latter was worried that her mother would blame her for Kara coming out as Supergirl. Greeting Eliza at the door, the three embraced, with Eliza complimenting Kara on her work as Supergirl, and telling Alex that she looked tired.

At the CatCo Plaza, Leslie Willis began her annual Thanksgiving week rant on her radio show, Alive and Wired With Leslie Willis. Announcing that the topic of choice for the rant was Supergirl, Leslie went on with her rant, with James Olsen, Winn Schott, and Cat Grant all listening with outrage due to her vulgarity and her excessive impudence. Later at CatCo Worldwide Media, Winn asked Kara about how Eliza's visit was turning out so far, with Kara telling him it was great. After questioning Winn about his plans for Thanksgiving and finding out he didn't have any, she invited him over for a "Friendsgiving" at her apartment, mentioning that he could act as a buffer between Eliza and Alex, and that they'd watch Orphan Black afterwards.

Soon after, Kara listened in to the conversation Cat was having with Leslie Willis in her office. Cat reminded Leslie that she had warned her not to go after Supergirl, and she crossed the line when she insulted her body, how she dresses and her sexuality. though Leslie brought up that was a part of their dynamic. An argument between the two ensued, where Cat explains that Supergirl has had a positive impact on National City - all Leslie is doing is just spouting uncalled for negativity that people are now sick of. They want optimism, hope and positivity, yet Leslie refuses to listen, with Cat transferring Leslie over to the traffic chopper, instead of buying her out of her contract. At Noonan's, Kara encountered James while picking up her takeout order and took the opportunity to invite him to her "Friendsgiving". While thanking her, James mentioned to Kara that he and Lucy were going to Ojai for the holiday, though it was only a few hours away, so if she needed anything just to give him a call. After James left with Lucy, Alex showed up at Noonan's as Kara was about to leave, revealing to Kara her theory that Eliza was secretly mad that Kara came out as Supergirl, but was hiding it. Though Kara tried to convince her otherwise, Alex pointed out that Eliza had always come down hard on her for not protecting Kara, prompting Kara to suggest that Alex tell Eliza about her real career as a D.E.O. agent.

Outside, the helicopter pilot told Leslie Willis that he was taking the helicopter back in as the lightning was too much, though Leslie rebuffed his statement, intent on covering traffic as Cat wanted her too. Seconds later, lightning hit the helicopter with the pilot losing control of the aircraft. Below, Kara and Alex witnessed the spiraling helicopter, with Kara telling Alex to clear the sidewalk as she changed into her Supergirl costume. Flying up to save the helicopter, the door of the helicopter fell off, with the Pilot falling out. Supergirl however caught him, and after setting him on the sidewalk she caught the helicopter before it crashed into a building. While grabbing ahold of Leslie's hand, lightning struck Supergirl and it deflected onto Leslie, putting her into the hospital.

The next day at the National City General Hospital, Kara and Cat visited Leslie, with Cat asking Kara how much time had to pass before it was appropriate for them to leave. After the two discussed Leslie's lack of family, and gifts from her fans in the room, Kara mentioned that Supergirl must feel awful. However, Cat shot back that she shouldn't as she saved Leslie, and that if anyone should feel bad it was her, as she was the one who had put her into the helicopter. After, Cat decided that they had been there long enough. Though before leaving, Cat attempted to coax Leslie who was still in a coma, awake. At Kara's apartment, Alex watched a news report about Supergirl saving Leslie Willis, while doing so, Eliza told her to turn it off. Eliza soon began to berate Alex for allowing Kara to become Supergirl, as Eliza thought she could count on her to look after Kara. Excusing herself to go handle something at her job, Alex left the apartment.

In the past, Eliza went outside to the porch to get her husband Jeremiah Danvers to keep her company while she did dissertation. On top of the roof, Kara convinced Alex to sneak out and go flying with her, despite the latter's initial protests. While holding onto Kara as she flew, Alex told her that it amazing. Elsewhere in National City, Leslie Willis wandered through an alley, discovering her newly gained powers, using them to subdue a drunken man who attempted to grab a hold of her. At Kara's apartment, Kara heated up the turkey with her heat vision, with Eliza admitting that she was worried the first time Kara did it, due to the potential radiation. Kara announced that before everyone ate, she wanted them to go around saying what they were all grateful for. After going first, Kara asked Alex to go next, though she declined, prompting her to ask Winn next, before excusing herself to answer a call from James.

After the two talked, with James admitting that he was a tad bored in Ojai, they both wished each other a Happy Thanksgiving. Back at the table, Winn questioned Eliza on her career, with Eliza explaining that she wasn't simply a scientist, rather a "bio-engineer", a career she shared with Alex. Grabbing a hold of the opportunity, Alex revealed her career as a D.E.O. agent to her mother, evoking her mother's anger. Feeling as if she'd never win with her mother, Alex angrily left, who was followed by Winn. Afterwards, Kara confronted Eliza as to why she was harder on Alex than her, and that it was her choice to become Supergirl. She soon left to handle an emergency for Cat Grant. In the past, Kara and Alex were caught sneaking in by Eliza and Jeremiah, and lectured about the rules as such. After someone knocked on the door, the girls were sent up to their room, with Eliza telling Kara not to use her super hearing to listen in on their conversation. Answering the door, Hank Henshaw along with two associates requested to speak with the two.

At CatCo, Cat explained that she had a last minute conference call to London and Beijing, yet nothing was working. Kara brought up that it was a possible sign that Cat shouldn't be working on the holiday, with Cat remarking that liked to do so. After mentioning that she needed Winn's help with the technical problems, the electricity in the building went out, with Leslie appearing on the screens in Cat's office, intent on settling the score with Cat. Appearing before the two, Leslie attacked Kara and Cat. While hiding, Cat sent Kara to go alert the security floors below. Leslie continued to look for Cat, eventually finding her and confronting her, telling Cat that she had transcended. Attempting to electrocute Cat, Supergirl came in through a window, shielding her from the blast, and attempting to plead with Leslie. Supergirl soon told Cat to leave, though Leslie followed her, messing up the elevator after she got in, and then escaping. Later, Kara discussed what had happened with Henshaw, who deduced that Kara was the Element X in Leslie getting her powers. After questioning Kara about Leslie's powers, Henshaw told Kara that she could be fought, as she did have a physical form, despite her powers being energy based.

Henshaw was soon after asked by Cat whether or not the F.B.I. was going to reimburse her for the damages they were doing to her building, though Henshaw told her that if she would allow them to put in a secure location it wouldn't be happening. However, Cat announced that CatCo would be open the next day for Black Friday, as she didn't get to her current position by running. While leaving, Hank told Kara that he had something at the D.E.O. that might be able to help her, a trap they used on one of their prisoners that came from a race consisting of pure energy. Back in Cat's office, though Kara asked if Cat needed anything, she was told that she could go home. The two soon had a conversation about the death of Kara's parents, her current family problems, and Cat's problems with her own mother. Deciding that it was her fault that Leslie turned into a monster, Kara agreed to ask the FBI for a direct line to Supergirl, as well as taking Cat's offer to go home.

At Kara's apartment, Alex arrived to check in on her mother, as black outs were occurring all over the city. Eliza asked Alex to come sit with her, apologizing for what she said about Alex's father earlier. Alex question why wasn't hadn't her actions ever been enough, with Eliza explaining that she wanted Alex to be better than her, and the reason she wasn't as hard on Kara was because she was a child from another planet who had lost everything, so she couldn't do anything else but accept her. As Eliza revealed there was something she needed to tell both Alex and Kara, Alex received a call from the D.E.O. telling them she'd be there in twenty minutes. At CatCo, Supergirl flew to Cat's balcony, with Cat suggesting they work together to capture Livewire, with Supergirl agreed to.

At the D.E.O. Kara was given an industrial capacitor to capture Leslie with, telling them that it was between her, Cat Grant, and Leslie Willis. Later, at CatCo Plaza, Cat called Leslie out on her radio show, telling Leslie to meet her "where it all began", as her grudge wasn't with National City, it was with her. There, Cat attempted to plead with Leslie, though to no avail. Supergirl appeared, and the two fought, with Leslie gaining the upper hand and electrocuting Supergirl. However, Cat was able to distract Leslie long enough for Supergirl to grab a water pipe under the street and short out Leslie with it. The next day at CatCo, Kara brought Winn left overs from Thanksgiving, and he revealed to her that what he was grateful for was her, kissing Kara on the cheek. Kara then greeted both James and Lucy, asking them about their trip. After Lucy left, James asked Kara how she was doing, to which she told him that she was glad to have him back.

In Cat Grant's office, Kara told her that the photo department had been calling. She was then questioned by Cat as to which story she would racy story she would run for the day, though Cat decided against both options, instead going with a photo-essay about people who spent their holiday volunteering at soup kitchens and shelters. Cat then admitted that there was a lot she didn't know about Kara, and that needed to change. Later in the day at Kara's apartment, both Kara and Alex embraced Eliza as she was about to leave. Eliza told Alex and Kara that she was proud of them, though there was room for improvement for Kara as Supergirl. Before leaving, Eliza revealed that Jeremiah died working for the D.E.O., under Hank Henshaw, and it was something that they needed to know if they were going to be working for the organization. At the D.E.O., Hank announced to Kara and Alex that they now had their first non-alien prisoner, and that since the holidays were over they could get back to catching aliens. After Henshaw left the two, they both agreed that they needed to find out what happened to Alex's father.</div>

<h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 5: "How Does She Do It?"</h1>
<div class="box">Supergirl flies above National City, when she notices red lasers on her forearm, from a drone that had been following her. She then proceeded to fly after the drone, destroying it with her heat vision. Afterwards, she brought the broken drone back to the D.E.O., accusing Hank Henshaw of spying on her, despite her having thought that they were gaining a mutual trust.

  Henshaw denied the allegations, and told her the drone wasn't the D.E.O.'s. Alex Danvers then arrived, inspecting the drone and confirming it was human made. Henshaw then made the declaration that the D.E.O. would handle it, and after he left, Alex reassured Kara that she could trust Hank. At CatCo Worldwide Media, Kara arrived as Winn Schott frantically attempted to cover for Kara, citing that it wasn't his job. After discovering that Cat had won the Siegel Award for Women in Media, Kara sought to book a plan for Grant, though while doing so she overheard Cat begging her mother to watch her son while she attended the ceremony for her award.
  
  Kara was soon called into the office, where Cat demanded her lunch. Kara congratulated Cat on winning her award, though Cat told her she couldn't attend because she didn't have anyone to watch her son, Carter. Kara then offered to watch Carter during the ceremony, with Cat agreeing, though telling Kara that Carter wasn't a normal boy who needed "special attention". Cat then beckoned for Kara to go get her lunch.
  
  At Noonan's, James Olsen questioned Lucy Lane as to why she was in National City. After attempting to excuse her presence by saying it was for work, she admitted that she had come because she had missed James. However, James told her that he had to leave as he was in charge of digital marketing while Cat was out of town, and that he'd give her a call if he wasn't too busy. As Lucy left, Kara and James discussed his and Lucy's situation, though a bomb was soon set off with Kara arriving at the scene as Supergirl to stop the building it went off in from collapsing. After fixing the structures with her heat vision, Kara blew out the fire with her super breath. At the D.E.O., they evaluated the situation, with Alex discovering that the bomb and the drone were connected, as both had been developed at Lord Technologies. Hank and Alex then agreed to go handle the situation, but disguised as F.B.I. agents.
  
  Kara then announced that she had to go back to work, with her and Alex discussing the James and Lucy situation. Alex warned Kara not to talk to James about his girl problems, as that was a quick way into the friend zone, with Kara agreeing with the statement. After confidently telling Kara that only an idiot would choose Lucy Lane over Supergirl, Kara answered a call from Cat Grant, who questioned her about Carter, reminding Kara that she needed to pick him up. At St. Edmund Hall, Kara attempted to talk to Carter, who listened but didn't respond initially. Elsewhere at Lord Technologies, Maxwell Lord talked with Hank and Alex, confirming it was his technology, though he wasn't worried with becoming their suspect as it was his lab that was destroyed.
  
  Alex questioned Maxwell as to whether he knew who'd be trying to target him, with Hank soon after telling Max that he was leaving Alex behind to protect him. Back at CatCo, Carter expressed his admiration of Supergirl to Kara, with Winn commenting that he had good taste. The trio then noticed James struggling the stapler in Cat's office, with James expressing his frustration, not knowing how Cat did it. James then received a call from Lucy, though he ignored it. He began to talk to Kara about Lucy once more, though Kara put an end to it, in an attempt to stay out of the friendzone.
  
  At Lord Technologies, Alex looked over the blueprints for Maxwell Lord's super train. Max questioned to as why she wasted her brain working for the government, with Alex telling him that she felt as if there was no higher calling than helping others. While the two talked, Max received a call from his assistant, Paulina, who told him to come down to Level 3. There, Paulina directed Maxwell to the bomb that he been discovered during a security sweep of the floor. Maxwell then took the bomb out of the case, and attempted to diffuse it, though it backfired, speeding up the countdown. Back at CatCo, Carter asked Kara whether she thought James could introduce him to Supergirl, Kara then received a call from Alex about the bomb in Lord Tech, with Kara asking Winn to watch Carter.
  
  Arriving at Lord Tech, Supergirl was told to get the bomb clear of the city. Flying away from National City, Hank Henshaw informed Kara to go upwards. While doing so, Hank ordered Kara to throw the bomb, however Kara refused as she felt she wasn't high enough. With three seconds left on the clock, Kara threw the bomb, being knocked unconscious from the bomb's explosion. Later, Kara awoke at the D.E.O., with Hank telling her that their rescue team had pulled her from the ocean. Alex then arrived in the room, embracing Kara. In the D.E.O.'s control center, Hank informed the Danvers sisters that they had discovered the identity of the bomber, Ethan Knox, a former Lord Technologies employee, who had been fired six months ago.
  
  Kara then questioned as to how they'd find him, though Alex told her she was staying home, as a fall from the height she had, would have rattled even Superman, and that Kara was spreading herself too thin. At CatCo, Kara arrived in Cat's office to find Winn and Carter playing video games on Cat's monitors behind her desk. She told Carter that she'd go get them some lunch, and thanked Winn for watching him. While at Noonan's Kara encountered Lucy Lane, who asked her whether James was dating anyone. Lucy then confided to Kara that she was worried James would fall for Supergirl, and that the reason her and James broke up was because she prioritized work in the past, because James prioritized Superman.
  
  At Lord Technologies, Alex confronted Maxwell about Ethan Knox, telling him to cancel his train's opening, as Ethan Knox would target the event. However, Maxwell refused to as he wouldn't be intimidated by terrorists. Back at CatCo, Kara apologized for cutting him off earlier when he attempted to talk to her about Lucy. She then told him about the conversation she had with Lucy at Noonan's, telling him that Lucy still loved him, and the reason she broke it off between the two of them was because she was tired of coming in second to Superman. Kara then told James to fight for love, before leaving to give Carter his lunch.
  
  Later, Kara arrived at the D.E.O. telling Hank and Alex that she would go to protect the train. Back at CatCo, Lucy went to tell James that she was leaving, and the two soon began to discuss their previous relationship problems, finally kissing, after the two agreed that they wanted the best for each other. Soon after, Winn noticed that Carter was missing, deducing that he went to the opening of Maxwell Lord's train to meet Supergirl. At the D.E.O., Agent Vasquez informed Hank and Alex that a bomb was discovered at Lord Air Terminal. Hank then informed Kara of the bomb, who told him that she was on the job. James as well was told, who then attempted to call Lucy, who was on her way there.
  
  At the train terminal, Carter was escorted onto the train by Maxwell Lord, with Winn arriving too late, and was denied entrance because of his lack of a ticket. Kara then received a call from Winn, who told her that Knox was on the train, and she deduced that there are two bombs, telling Alex and Hank to handle the airport, and she'd handle the train bomb. Arriving on the train, Supergirl alerted Lord of the bomb, and told him and Carter to get all of the passengers to the back of the train. Back at the Lord Air terminal, James and Lucy were reunited, and Hank along with Alex went inside the air terminal to diffuse the bomb. While there, Hank ordered Alex to get clear of the room while he diffused the bomb.
  
  On the train, Kara opened the door leading to Ethan Knox. She attempted plead with him to deactivate the bomb, telling him to think of his daughter. At the air terminal, Hank Henshaw walked out, holding the successfully diffused bomb over his head. He then lied to Alex telling her it was a dud, when questioned as to how he diffused it. Back on the train, Ethan activated the bomb, telling Supergirl to save the passengers, as she only had 30 seconds. Supergirl then detached the train car that Ethan was in from the rest of the train, watching it, along with him, blow up from a distance. At the D.E.O., Kara and Alex discussed the day's events, with both agreeing that several things weren't adding up.Soon after Kara, realized that Cat would be angry after finding out that Carter had been on the train.
  
  The next morning, Carter greeted his mother as she arrived at CatCo, with the two embracing. Before getting him off to school, Carter asked whether Kara could watch him again after reminiscing about the fun he had with her, though Cat told him to hold onto the memories. After Carter left, Kara apologized for letting Carter getting on the train, telling Cat that she didn't know how she balanced worked, and being a mother. Kara was then told by Cat that you could have it all - just not right away. Leaving out of Cat's office, Kara witnessed James and Lucy kissing. At her desk, Kara and Winn watched Maxwell Lord on the news, wondering why he was getting choked up about Ethan Knox's death. Kara then asked Winn to hack into hospital records.
  
  Later that night, Kara as Supergirl confronted Maxwell Lord, telling him that she knew he had Ethan Knox plant the bombs, in exchange for saving his daughter's life. Though Lord denied doing so, he called it a theory worth exploring, and dissected the recent attacks, implying that he had done it all to test Supergirl, and furthermore discover her identity. Kara then warned him that she watching him, and it wasn't over, to which Max agreed.</div>

  <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 6: "Red Faced"</h1>
  <div class="box">Supergirl happily flies above National City, with Alex Danvers checking in on her over their shared intercom. Unfortunately, Supergirl's peaceful flight comes to an abrupt end as Kara hears a road rage between two men using her super hearing and flies down to end it. Supergirl arrives and abruptly stops the cars before several children are hit in a school zone crosswalk. One of the men gets out of his car, angry at Supergirl because she broke his nose and totaled his car. Supergirl yells back at him. He then attempts to hit Supergirl, though she catches his punch and twists his arm, hurting the man and scaring the children in the process.

    At the D.E.O. headquarters, Hank Henshaw reprimands Supergirl for losing her temper, reminding her that there is a reason that some people feared Superman. Not because of his powers, but of what he might do with them if he ever lost his temper. Afterwards, Agent Vasquez shows Supergirl a video of Maxwell Lord criticizing her recent actions. At Noonan's, James Olsen and Lucy Lane have coffee together. Before she leaves for work, Lucy tells James that her father, General Sam Lane, is coming to town and wants to have dinner with them. After he agrees, Lucy leaves, passing by Kara on her way out and thanking her for the "invite". Kara then goes over to James, making sure everything is okay. James explains that he and Lucy's father don't get along because James consorts with aliens and the general is against them. During their conversation, James explains that he invites Lucy to their regular game night, with Kara reassuring James before leaving that she is fine with it.
    
    At CatCo Worldwide Media, Cat Grant asks her mother what brings her to National City. Katherine replies that she is there for a book tour, and expresses criticism towards Cat for calling Supergirl a girl, rather than "Superwoman". Throughout the conversation, Katherine repeatedly demeans and patronizes her daughter both subtly and overtly, but Cat does not confront the psychological abuse. Arriving at CatCo, Kara comes across Alex, who is there to get Winn to hack into the D.E.O. mainframe to find out what happened to her father. Though initially reluctant, Alex and Kara explain the situation to Winn, and the two successfully persuad him to do so. Both Kara and Alex are then summoned by Henshaw. Later, at the D.E.O. base camp, General Lane arrives, ordering Henshaw to have Supergirl fight their field robot, Red Tornado.
    
    Back at CatCo in their base of operations, Kara told Winn and James of her fight with Red Tornado the next day. After reassuring Winn that game night—one of the last vestiges of normalcy in her life—will not be cancelled, Kara walks with Cat Grant, telling her that dinner with her mother is booked for the night. Arriving in her office, Cat's mother cancels dinner with her, since she wants to attend a private dinner with Toni Morrison and other famous people instead. After her mother leaves, Cat asks Kara for the proofs for the revised fashion spread, though after looking them over, she demands that Kara take them back to editing to be retouched. Before Kara leaves for editing, Cat criticizes her over the way she throws herself at James after hearing about their "office game night", and tells her to be more professional. Kara is miffed at the insult, but she doesn't fight back.
    
    Later at Kara Danvers' apartment, James and Lucy are winning against Kara and Winn at game night. After Superman is mentioned in the game they'd been playing, Lucy tells the group of how she'd met Supergirl earlier that day and wasn't impressed. The next day, Supergirl flies to the D.E.O. base camp for her fight with Red Tornado. While there, Kara tells Alex that she is craving a good fight. As the fight begins, Red Tornado knocks Supergirl back with his wind abilities, and sends missiles after her. She then burrows into the ground, sneaks up behind him and knocks him over. As the fight progresses, Supergirl losses her temper, breaking off Red Tornado's arm in the process. Red Tornado then flies away, and Supergirl is informed by his creator, T.O. Morrow, that the fight has caused the robot to go into self-preservation mode. Sam Lane berates Supergirl for her recklessness, accusing her of unleashing an unstoppable killing machine on National City.
    
    Back at the D.E.O., Sam Lane demands that Red Tornado be found and destroyed. However, T.O. Morrow speaks against that order, as he had invested too much time and money into Red Tornado. General Lane then fires him, citing that both Morrow and Red Tornado have failed. At CatCo, Cat repeatedly calls for Kara. Kara then arrives, being reprimanded for not coming when she was called. In the middle of being criticized, Kara verbally lashes out at Cat, as she is frustrated with always being yelled at, despite working hard at her job, on top of all the other stressors and recent failures in her life. As soon as the words leave her mouth, Kara is mortified by what she has done, and she apologizes profusely. Cat shushes her and tells her to forward the phones as they were going somewhere.
    
    Elsewhere, at Lord Technologies, Maxwell Lord greets Alex. She presents Max with Red Tornado's arm and says she needs help finding the android. However, Max refuses, telling her that he is "kind of busy". At dinner with General Lane, things get tense between James and the general after Lucy goes to powder her nose. James reveals that he knows why General Lane was in National City, and Lane finally tells James that he isn't good enough for Lucy—that he surrounds himself with special people because he's not good enough himself. Kara and Cat have drinks together at Noonan's, with Cat giving Kara advice on controlling her temper at work. Cat tells her that she needs to find an outlet, and more importantly, she needs to find the anger behind her anger. Upon exiting the restaurant, General Lane, Lucy, and James are confronted by Red Tornado, with James using his signal watch to alert Supergirl. Red Tornado hits Lucy with an air blast, knocking her back into a table.
    
    As Red Tornado attempted to attack General Lane, Supergirl arrived, intercepting his punch. A fight between the two ensue, with Red Tornado creating a tornado that begins traveling down a busy street in National City, allowing the android to escape while Supergirl rescues everyone. Supergirl successfully disperses the tornado by flying circles inside it. Back at the D.E.O., General Lane reprimands Supergirl for letting Red Tornado get away, telling her that if anything else happens, both she and the D.E.O. will be held accountable. Hank Henshaw then arrives, telling Lane he discovered that they have made the android to kill Kryptonians, and that Lane owes Supergirl his gratitude instead of his contempt.
    
    Alex arrives at Lord Technologies, as Maxwell wants to see her concerning the Red Tornado situation. The two begin to talk, with Max telling her he wants to know who he is working with, and both confiding in each other regarding their parents. Lord then informs her that Red Tornado isn't acting alone, as Red Tornado is a drone—and that Morrow is in fact still controlling it. At a garage, Kara and James blow off steam together, saying what they are mad about and letting their fists fly, with Kara hitting a car and James a punching bag. During their session, Kara losses her temper, then reveals to James the "anger behind her anger": that she thinks she'll never find love or a normal life. She is then called away by Alex, who has found something and wants Kara to meet her at the D.E.O.
    
    At the D.E.O., Alex informs Hank and Kara that Morrow is still controlling Red Tornado, and they can find Morrow by drawing out Red Tornado and then tracing the relay signal that Morrow is using to control Tornado, back to him. Kara reassures Hank that she can control her anger, and Henshaw told General Lane that they had a plan to fix his mess, but he'd need his help. Later, the D.E.O. used hologram technology to draw out Red Tornado and get a fix on Morrow's location. As Red Tornado attacked the hologram, Supergirl flew herself as a projectile at the android, with the two engaging each other in battle.
    
    Elsewhere, Alex confronted Morrow, who revealed that he was neurally linked to the android now. He tells Alex that she'll have to kill him to stop Red Tornado, then he begins to attack her. The fight results in Morrow's death, which momentarily stops Red Tornado—until it becomes sentient and continues to attack Kara. However, Kara uses her heat vision in an attempt to stop Red Tornado. The android continues advancing, but Supergirl unleashes her anger and intensifies her heat vision until the powerful blast causes Red Tornado to explode. Kara then confirms to Hank that she is okay over her intercom. Later at Noonan's, Lucy tells her father that she is resigning from the military and staying in National City with James, though General Lane disapproved. At Kara's apartment, Winn informs Alex that her father went missing on a mission with Hank Henshaw in South America, with Hank being the last person to see Jeremiah Danvers alive.
    
    At CatCo, Katherine berates Kara for not calling her a car to the airport. She then continues to rant to Cat about Kara's ineptitude and worthlessness, which causes Cat to tell her mother that Kara is excellent at her job, and she isn't allowed to speak to her that way—as she is Cat's assistant. Afterwards, Kara thanks Cat for her kind words, though Cat tells her it is just for effect. While cleaning up a glass from a cup she has dropped, Kara cuts her finger, which, much to her surprise, begins to bleed.</div>

    <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 7: "Human For a Day"</h1>
    <div class="box">In the wake of her recent battle with Red Tornado, Kara's powers have been drained after she used the full power of her heat vision. As such was pointed out by Alura Zor-El's hologram during her moment alone with it, in the D.E.O.'s Kryptonian fortress chamber. Kara is told that her abilities should return in a few days, which is what Hank Henshaw is hoping for even though Kara is concerned about her powers never returning. Alex, more suspicious than ever, tells Kara that she doesn't trust Hank anymore but urges Kara to enjoy her day without her powers. At work, Kara has come down with a cold and informs Winn about her status, and when Cat sees her sneeze she sends Kara home for the rest of the day.

      Back at the DEO, an alien conqueror known as Jemm is determined to escape, but Hank informs the psychic criminal that the neural shielding can withstand his powers. Jemm threatens Hank's family, but Hank tells him that he has none. Meanwhile, Kara and James bump into one another, who tells her that he and Lucy are getting a place together. When Kara starts sneezing, James instantly concludes that she lost her powers. All of a sudden, an earthquake starts to erupt. As a car heads towards Kara's way, James knocks her out of the way, but Kara sustains a broken arm. The earthquake has everyone taking precautions, with Cat informing necessary personnel to stay while Winn gets everything back online just in time to see Maxwell slam Supergirl for not coming to the rescue, prompting Kara and James to stop him from going any further. When the two visit Maxwell, he is unfazed, claiming that Supergirl no longer has her powers due to her recent fight with Red Tornado and may never get them back. The earthquake also causes damage at the Department of Extranormal Operations, causing a power outage and an opportunity for Jemm to escape his cell. Hank and Alex seek out Alura for advice and gather a team to go after Jemm with psychic disruptor helmets. Believing he can trust Alex, Hank asks her to stay behind. When Hank does meet up with Jemm, he has already taken out his security guards, before Hank vanishes altogether. He returns and tells Alex that Jemm is using his power to control the security and fellow guards, and plans to stop him with a neural inhibitor. He wants Alex to remain at her post as well, but Alex decides it time to find out what Hank is trying to do behind her back. Back on the streets, Maxwell attempts to save a woman's father in front of Kara and James, but, in the absence of an X-ray machine to find a venous thrombosis, he fails. Without her power of X-ray vision, Kara is unable to save the man as well, making her feel helpless. Suddenly, just as James is ready to help her overcome her loss of her powers, Kara hears a robbery happening nearby. She shows up as Supergirl, barely keeping the pain of her broken arm under control, and talks the robber out of it, resulting in the criminal turning the gun over to her and James snapping a photo of the event. Back at the DEO, Jemm uses his powers on Alex's partner and kills him just as Alex is tackled into a room by Hank, only to discover that Jemm plans to free the prisoners. Alex makes Hank handcuff himself to a wall, revealing she knows about his connection to her father's death, and wants Jemm to come to the control room. Back at CatCo, James shows Kara the picture he took of her and the two share a moment, resulting in Kara thanking him for his encouragement with a hug just as Winn shows up with information that will restore Kara's powers - which is an adrenaline rush. Upset over seeing the two hug, Winn bitterly reminds Kara that James has a girlfriend and when her powers return she won't ever be able to have a normal life or relationship. When reports of a gas explosion hits the building, the three attempt to help the people trapped on the floor above them, with James climbing the ladder to open the doors and rescuing everyone. However, he loses his grip on the ladder and begins to fall down the elevator shaft. He grabs on to an elevator rope but it was beginning to snap and this was beginning to Horrify Kara. But then Kara clenches her broken arm and looks at it in a serious face, to which after it the line snaps and James to fall. Then Winn turns and sees that Kara is gone with her cast laying on the ground, as Kara now somehow in her Supergirl suit saves James.

Meanwhile, Jemm comes looking for Alex, who is ready with a gun and attacks him, taking out his third eye. However, he gains the upper hand and prepares to finish her off when he is suddenly knocked out by Hank, who exhibits an unnatural level of strength. Hank then turns on the lights and tells Alex that he's truly not the enemy. Alex still demands answers, and he tells her that he's is not actually Hank Henshaw, explaining how he had died alongside her father when they were tracking a lost alien in Peru who was seeking refuge. Henshaw had wanted to kill the alien, but Jeremiah objected to such a cruel plan and died stopping him. He tells her that Danvers died a hero, and Alex realizes that Henshaw is the alien that her father saved and he reveals himself as a shape shifter who copied Henshaw's appearance in order to reform the DEO. He then reveals himself as J'onn J'onzz, who is the last surviving member of the Martian race. He also tells Alex that he promised her father that he would look after her, hence, why he recruited her into the organization in order to keep an eye on her.

Later on, Kara invites Winn to her home, but he declines, saying he's never disappointed in Supergirl, but he was disappointed in her. He leaves as Kara and James see each other from across the hall and share a moment looking at each other before James leaves as well. Kara as Supergirl then arrives outside Cat's window, where she demands to know why Supergirl abandoned them. However, Supergirl informs Cat that she already inspired both humanity, and Supergirl, to tackle things. Unfortunately, on her way back home, Kara is suddenly attacked by three Kryptonians, led by her Aunt Astra.</div>
<hr>
<h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 8: "Hostile Takeover"</h1>
<div class="box">After being taken down by Aunt Astra and her assistants, Kara fights them off, as Astra informs her niece that she has found a way to counter the Kryptonite with devices strapped to them so they won't be weakened. Astra entices Kara to join them but Kara refuses and leaves. She then returns to the D.E.O. to inform Alex and Hank, but they don't want Kara to rush back for now and suggests she gets some rest, with Alex informing Kara to trust Hank for now. The following morning at CatCo, news has leaked about Cat's e-mail server being hacked, revealing embarrassing messages from Cat that are damaging even her lawyers are suggesting that she should not make matters worse. As Kara tells Cat that this issue will be resolved, Cat calls for a meeting and asks the board to go through her e-mails for anything incriminating. Cat also asks Kara to bring in Winn and James for help as the leaked e-mails become front-page news at The Daily Planet, but the task is also causing jealousy between Winn and James, not to mention Kara as well.

  At the same time in another part of the universe, Astra is asked by Non, her Lieutenant and husband, about why she didn't kill Kara, with Astra explaining that she doesn't want to because she is family, but adds "I will die before I allow another world to end before I can save it." At the D.E.O., Kara and Alex practices on each other during an exercise, but as Kara starts to get more confident in her abilities the more she becomes unfocused as her anger starts to consume her. Alex chides her for hesitating, then tells Kara that the D.E.O. should handle the Kryptonian threat from Astra because of family. Alex asks whether she's actually ready to kill if necessary, and Kara says that Superman doesn't kill, but it won't work for Astra.
  
  In a flashback, Astra goes to meet Kara and tells her niece that Krypton is dying as the core is unstable and that she's trying to save it, but she's had to do some bad things to save the world. Astra then tells Kara that she was leaving the planet, but not before saying goodbye to Kara, only to have this moment interrupted by Alura, who wants to speak with her twin sister and tells Kara to leave them.
  
  Back in the present day, Cat is relieved that there was no evidence of anything to slander her after Kara and James informed her, but at the meeting the board members ask her to take a step back and put some distance between herself and the company. After the meeting, Cat tells Kara to keep looking for any more leaks, as she suspects board member Dirk Armstrong is going to find some way to damage Cat's reputation. Kara, using her hearing, listens to Armstrong admitting to having set Cat up. Kara then asks James to enlist Lucy's help in tracking a paper trail to clear Cat's name. Lucy tells them that if their hunch is right, Armstrong could potentially face criminal charges. Suddenly, the three look at a TV set and see Astra hovering above requesting for Kara to talk to her. Kara (as Supergirl) arrives to confront her, which in turn leads to a battle that resulted in Supergirl preventing debris from killing innocent bystanders, only to be bested by Astra, who stands over Kara and tells her that Alura was weak and a liar, but Kara says her mother's only weakness was letting Astra live and then resumes the battle but relents after she noticed Astra in tears and falls unconscious. Kara takes Astra back to the D.E.O., where Alex says they'll call her when Astra wakes up, but Kara turns that down.
  
  Winn has found a way to hack into Armstrong's servers and asks James to plant a bug in his office computer. Using a diversion, Kara and James narrowly succeeds, and when Dirk returns he sees James at his desk, saying he'll support him if Cat leaves. Meanwhile, Astra produces a communicator she and Kara used on Krypton and tells her it's time she knew the truth, as she kept the communicator to remind herself of what she was fighting for. She tells Kara that Alura betrayed her, but Kara refuses to believe her Aunt, but then asks whether it was Kara's idea to contact her with the beacon, which is revealed in a flashback when Alura sentenced Astra and Non for murder, despite Astra's plea to save Krypton, and tells her that Earth is on the verge of ecological destruction, but that the humans won't listen to her. Astra is begging Kara to help but her niece leaves, and Astra says she loves her. Kara goes to the hologram to ask if Alura had used her to get Astra arrested, which the hologram confirms, and whether Krypton could have been saved if Astra was right, but the hologram repeatedly says it is unable to answer her second question. Kara breaks down crying and destroys the hologram with her heat vision in frustration, saying her mother lied to her. Alex tells her that she doesn't know what really happened, and Kara says that she knows both she and Astra "were given life sentences by my mother."
  
  Back at work, Kara refused to discuss the issue with James and Winn, but James did find information on financial records that linked Cat to Adam Foster in Opal City, who James and Winn think she been paying money to. When Kara goes to see Cat, she reveals that Adam is her son and his father was somebody she hadn't dated in a while. Cat sued for custody of Adam but lost, then gave up and dropped the lawsuit because she believed that she would be in his life anyway, but eventually determined that her child might be better off without her. Cat says she stopped second-guessing that decision years ago and admits her regret. Rather than allow Adam to end up in the middle of a media storm, Cat decided to resign from CatCo. However at the last minute, thanks to Lucy, Winn and James, they managed to provide Cat information on Dirk. Cat confronts Dirk in her office with the evidence. Dirk admits to the hacking, but initially threatens to fight. However, since Dirk used the company's computers to hack Cat's e-mails so he can take over the company, he doesn't have a leg to stand on. Cat fires Dirk and has him arrested. Afterwards, Kara steps away as James apologizes to Winn, who tries to downplay his feelings about Kara, but James says he's not in Winn's way, and that if he has feeling for Kara, he should tell her and reminds Winn that Kara is special, not because she's Supergirl, she's worth risking it for and he should try.
  
  Back at the D.E.O., Hank asked Alex about Kara. Hank is unable to read Astra's mind; Kryptonians are immune to his telepathy. However, they suspect something is amiss when they see footage of Astra stepping over Kara. Knowing that Astra has been a warrior all her life, they find it hard to believe she would put herself in sch a position. Suspecting that Astra wanted to lose to Supergirl as a diversion, they confront Astra, just in time to inform them that Non and an army of Kryptonians are invading Lord Technogies. When they arrive, Maxwell is ready to greet them with weapons, but they're no match for the kryptonite-immune invaders. Meanwhile, Kara goes to Cat, and Kara is surprised to learn that Cat found out that she was Supergirl, having figured out the recent encounters whenever they were around. She tells her to take off her glasses, and thanks her for all the help she's given her, calling her Supergirl. When Kara gets a call from Alex, she excuses herself to help the others fight Non and his army, with Hank using his powers to disable one of the Kryptonians' shields to weaken him after he found out Hank wasn't human. Kara suddenly arrives and is ready to battle Non.</div>

  <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 9: "Blood Bonds"</h1>
  <div class="box">At Lord Technologies, Hank tries to intervene in the fight between Non and Kara but is abducted by Non. Maxwell orders the D.E.O. to leave and refuses to reveal what the Kryptonians might have been looking for; he later makes a public statement blaming the attack on corporate espionage. At D.E.O. headquarters, Hank's secret emergency protocols reveal that Alex is his designated successor. Kara asks Astra where Non took Hank, but she refuses to divulge anything. Astra emphasizes that Kara has chosen sides against her.

    Kara tells James and Winn that Cat believes her to be Supergirl, a premise Cat continues to explore through various challenges to Kara's identity. Non contacts the D.E.O. while Kara is present, offering to trade Hank for Astra. Alex agrees, but is countermanded by General Lane, who has been put in charge of the D.E.O. by a presidential order. James tries to investigate at Lord Technologies; his suspicions are raised by his observations of the damage to the facility, but Maxwell orders him off the premises.
    
    At Astra's headquarters, Non kills a mind reading alien who finds Hank impervious to his abilities. At the D.E.O., Sam interrogates Astra by torturing her with a kryptonite injection, to Kara's horror and over her strenuous objections. James tells Kara that he has no leads on what Maxwell was hiding, but Winn later confronts James, who admits that he does have a line of investigation. Winn agrees to help bypass Maxwell's security systems; James successfully infiltrates the building, but is stopped by a biometric lock and then caught by Maxwell and his security force, who beat up James and throw him out. Astra reveals Hank's supposed location, but it's a trap; Kara saves Alex and a soldier from an explosion.
    
    Cat decides that Supergirl's energies are wasted on the pretense of being an errand girl; if Kara can't prove that she isn't Supergirl, Cat will fire her. Later, Kara thanks Cat for the opportunity to work with her and resigns, explaining that Cat's suspicions make it impossible for her to do her job. Kara then discovers James' injuries and declares she will go after Maxwell. Winn notes that she is talking like Astra, and instead needs to let him and James investigate and find another way to expose Maxwell. Kara visits Astra and asks to hear the truth; Astra reveals that Alura believed Astra's claims about the planetary crisis, and sentenced Astra on the basis of her crimes, without losing faith in her. Astra favorably likens Kara to Alura, and tells her that going through with the exchange is the only way to rescue Hank. Kara decides to do so, but General Lane threatens to stop her by force. However, he is unable to follow through when the soldiers follow the lead of their fellow whom Supergirl rescued, who refuses to act against her. The trade is made, but then Non springs an ambush; however, Astra calls off the attack, demanding that a reluctant Non honor the agreement, though it is not a truce.
    
    Back at the D.E.O., Kara asks from Hank, what Alex meant when she said he needed to transform. Alex and Hank then take Kara to another room and Kara is stunned, when they explain that Hank is actually a Martian. Kara Doesn't understand, why they didn't tell her, claiming she could've kept a secret. Hank and Alex counter it by saying she can't.
    
    At CatCo, Hank uses his shapeshifting ability to impersonate Supergirl so that Cat can see her and Kara at the same time. Cat accepts that she must have been wrong, and offers Kara her job back on the condition that she not reveal Cat's embarrassing mistake. Hank offers Kara a full-time job at the D.E.O., but she tells him that her relationships at CatCo are what humanizes her. She has an online chat with Superman, who offers her emotional support, and assistance if she ever needs it. He reiterates a Kryptonian proverb that has been a motif throughout the episode: "Blood bonds us all," referring to all Kryptonians but by extension all sapient life. James, Winn, and Kara commit to stopping Maxwell.
    
    At Room 52 of the secret facility inside Lord Technologies, Maxwell checks on a test subject, a young blonde woman who apparently died from brain trauma. She opens her eyes, revealing them to be entirely black.</div>

    <div class="box">At the Maximum Security Prison, a pair of guards check on Winslow "Toyman" Schott Sr. while they bring him a meal. When they open his cell they assume that he is sick and in need of medical attention, but soon discover a talking doll on his bed and become his victims of a trap as a yo-yo with blades kills the guards. Taking one of the guard's uniforms, he then attacks another pair of guards, killing them with the same device. During a flight together, Kara convinces J'onn to embrace his powers and reveal himself to the world, but J'onn refuses to do that, saying he likes his current identity as Hank. They are joined by Alex as the three come up with a plan to find out what Maxwell is hiding at Lord Technologies. Later on at CatCo, Cat offers Lucy a job despite a conflict of interest because of James, but is convinced to take the offer. As James and Winn asks Kara to listen in on the conversation, the news reports of Winn's father becomes the top story and Winn wants nothing to do with it, and when agent Cameron Chase arrived to talk to Winn about his father's whereabouts, Winn tells her that he has not seen his father and wants nothing to do with him. Kara then confronts Winn, who admits that his father, who was a toy designer, was responsible for the death of six people at the company he worked for after his boss took credit for his father's designs, although his boss, the intended target, survived. Winn then shows Kara a doll he received on his desk, which contained a voice message, indicating that Winslow Sr. wants to meet him at their favorite place, and goes to Cameron to tell her.

      Back at the DEO, Alex attempts to convince J'onn to use his powers to infiltrate Lord Industries but J'onn is refusing because it would make him relive his past as the Martian Manhunter. However, Alex does call Maxwell out for a date, giving J'onn time to sneak in and get the information. That evening, as Alex and Maxwell have their dinner (that turns into a conversation over their "association" with Supergirl), J'onn posing as Maxwell sneaks in and finds the mystery woman. When J'onn trips over the alarm a guard shows up but J'onn erases his memory and tells the woman he'll be back. When Maxwell returns, he discovers the guard has no memory of anything, including his own family. Meanwhile, Kara questions Cat's reason for hiring Lucy, only to have Cat accuse Kara of making eyes at James. James later discovers Lucy in his office, but he's reluctant to have her working at the company. Lucy wants the job and is upset that he does not support her.
      
      At an arcade, Winn finds his father, who despite his dislike for Winslow Sr., the elder reminds his son that they are much alike. However, as Cameron and her agents closes in on Winslow Sr., they are tricked by a wall of mirrors and tells Winn Jr. to leave as the mirrors collapse. A cloud of gas appears ready to take out the agents but Kara as Supergirl arrived to inhale the gas and disperse it into the air. Cameron tells Winn Jr. that she is not convinced that he wants nothing to do with Winslow Sr., leading to Winn Jr. to believe that Cameron wants to have his father killed. Kara tells a reluctant Winn Jr. that she will find his father. Back at CatCo, Winn Jr. realizes that his father must be hiding in an abandoned factory that he use to own and Kara flies off to capture him before the FBI does.
      
      When she arrives at the factory Kara is trapped in quicksand and hears a girls voice from an overhead box that is about to be dropped into a shredder. She escapes but discovers a Supergirl doll in the box, allowing Winslow Sr. to escape. At Kara's Apartment, Winn Jr. wants to call Cameron, but Kara talks him out of it and convinces him not go down the same path as his father. After being encouraged by Kara, Winn Jr. tried to kiss Kara but Winn Jr. is rejected by Kara, and he leaves upset. He is then kidnapped by Winslow Sr. and is taken to a warehouse. He reveals that his whole plan is for Winn to kill his former boss, Chester Dunholz so that they can be together in prison. To ensure his compliance Winslow Sr. says that he has hidden ten bombs in random toys at the convention and he will set them off if Winn does not go through with it.
      
      The following day, Cameron shows up at CatCo, where she and Cat are combing for clues to find out if Winn Jr. is working for his father. As Chester Dunholz, makes his speech, Winn Jr. arrives with the weapon (disguised as a plastic gun). As Winn fires the gun into the air Cameron and the FBI agents shoot to kill him, but Supergirl stops them, and uses her x-ray vision to see Winslow Sr. set the bombs on a timer. She opens the sprinklers to create a frozen shield that foils Winslow Sr.'s plans and then subdues him. Afterwards at CatCo, James admits to Lucy that he wasn't enthusiastic about working alongside her but they kiss and make up.
      
      After Kara sees this, she tries to apologize to Winn, who in turn apologized for kissing her but because of his feelings for her is not so sure at this point. Later that evening Kara, flies in with her Supergirl outfit on into her apartment, confiding to Alex about Winn's feelings for her and admits she felt guilty about it. Alex then admits to Kara that she convinced J'onn to infiltrate Lord Technologies, which Kara had reservations but Alex believes he can do it. Unaware to the sisters, Maxwell had planted a recording device in Alex's purse, confirming his suspicions that they're sisters.</div>

      <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 11: "Strange Visitor From Another Planet"</h1>
      <div class="box">As Kara rescues a family from a forest fire, she reads a letter that she dictated about Cat's son, Adam. When she later meets up with Alex to talk about Winn, they run into guy who was asking about Cat, with Kara hoping that Cat will meet him soon. The two then see on the TV screen Senator Miranda Crane rallying around an anti-alien propaganda, which James has volunteered to cover despite Cat's dislike for Crane because of her views. Cat also is upset with Kara when she sees a person in her office and calls security; its her son Adam. She wants to have dinner with him but he turns her down. Cat then threatens Kara for interfering, but Kara, on the verge of being fired, turns things around by offering to have the two dine together by getting them reservations.

        Outside near City Hall, Miranda's speech continues to draw crowds as Hank and Alex check the area for alien activity when a fast-moving white alien appears and attacks. Alex and Hank races to stop him but suddenly Hank's vision of what happened on Mars starts to come back and Alex saves him before he is run over. James immediately uses his watch and Kara as Supergirl appears, rescuing Miranda and against her wishes takes her to the DEO headquarters. Alex also questioned Hank about why he froze, and he explained to both Alex and Kara that he knows the attacker: it's a White Martian, part of a subterranean race that wiped out dozens of his people on Mars, including his entire family. Hank wants to handle the attacker personally, but fears that if he reveals himself to the world, General Lane will try to take over the DEO. However, Kara tells J'onn she will help him.
        
        At CatCo, Kara helps Cat out with getting to know Adam while at dinner, which later on becomes awkward and as expected does not go well after Adam found out about the letter. James shows photos of the attack to Kara, who notices that some of them show Miranda's eyes glowing white—much like those of the White Martian. James remembers those pictures were taken after Kara supposedly rescued Miranda. Realizing what this means, Kara calls Alex at the DEO. Back at the DEO, "Miranda" plays mind games with Hank about an alien mole within the DEO and threatens to out the DEO if he doesn't conduct an investigation. When she suddenly mentions that she was attacked by a White Martian, Hank becomes suspicious.
        
        Kara tells Alex that the White Martian is at the DEO, disguised as Miranda. Alex arrives with a gun pointed at "Miranda" just as Hank goes for his weapon, but the White Martian is too quick for them. She goes on a rampage through the building. J'onn suddenly starts having visions of White Martians taking a group of Green Martians. Just as Miranda is about to attack, Kara shows up to challenge her only to have the White Martian escape. Kara is then distracted by Cat and returns to CatCo, who is upset over the dinner earlier because of the letter, which prompts Kara to go see Adam personally. After a short talk and an admission from Kara about the letter, Adam agrees to meet with his mother on the condition that Kara joins them. During their dinner, Kara acts as a mediator and after tense talking both Cat and Adam start having a normal mother-son relationship.
        
        Alex tells J'onn that she felt bad for encouraging him for using his powers and shouldn't be at fault, but J'onn tells Alex about how the White Martians killed his family, including his wife and daughters, K'hym and Tanya, before he escaped. He then examined a tissue that came from "Miranda" and over Alex's concerns tracks the impostor down by hovering above the city using telepathy, leading him to her lair located in a sewer. As Hank, he brought Alex and the DEO agents in to capture the White Martian, and stumble upon the real Miranda Crane and rescue her, except for Alex, who becomes bait after the fake Crane captures her.
        
        J'onn then uses telepathy to negotiate with the White Martian while telling Kara to rescue Alex so he can kill her, which Kara objects to. The two arrive in the desert ready to come face to face with Miranda and pleads with her to let Alex go. J'onn is ready to surrender to the White Martian but Kara stops the alien and J'onn transforms into the Martian Manhunter and a battle ensues between all three. J'onn decides to take it further as he places Kryptonite cuffs on Kara so he can kill the White Martian, but Kara talks him out of it and he gives in. After they place the White Martian in the DEO cell, the alien vows there are millions like her ready to kill J'onn and won't rest until he's dead, but Kara tells her she's ready for them. The real Miranda later thanked Supergirl and is ready to change her mind about her feelings about aliens.
        
        Later that evening Adam visits Cat to tell her he is staying in town, as it turns out he has a crush on Kara, and immediately asks her out on a date. This prompts Kara to ask Alex about dating tips but Alex tells Kara to have fun. Meanwhile, in another part of National City, a car is dangling along a bridge ready to fall, when a mysterious woman who looks like Supergirl flies in and picks up the vehicle, then drops it. The event is caught on television, where the Danvers sisters see it.</div>

        <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 12: "Bizarro"</h1>
        <div class="box">Three months prior to Bizarro's first public appearance, Maxwell Lord entered the room in which she was kept and started transferring a black liquid into her comatose body, sending her into violent convulsions as her veins briefly protruded from her skin. Upon opening her eyes as the convulsions stopped, they had turned completely black, prompting him to remark that "she's alive". One day before her appearance, Maxwell Lord was in her room again and boasted about his many achievements - but said she is his most perfect creation and kissed her hand. Bizarro is revealed to now perfectly resemble Kara Danvers and is able to speak and understand him, while the black in her eyes fade to normal eyes. In the D.E.O., J'onn J'onzz and Alex Danvers rules out alien activity; Kara suggests a clone, but Alex says it is impossible and thinks it may have something to do with the woman J'onn found when he broke into Lord's lab. He states her brain is too damaged to heal, and that Lord is no god. Kara denies to Winn Schott that the woman in the news is her. Cat Grant arrives with not only her own latte but also Kara's go-to order, to the latter's confusion. Cat glances at Winn, who looks away embarrassed. At CatCo, reporters suggested several headlines regarding Bizarro's appearance, but Cat is unsatisfied until Kara proposed that it may not be Supergirl. Cat comes up with the headline "Supergirl?" and dismisses everyone. Kara asks her if she is being nice because Kara is dating her son, but she refuses to answer. Kara is slightly freaked out over Cat's attitude, but she decides to focus on Bizarro along with Winn and James Olsen. Kara receives a text from Adam and James said he seems like a terrific guy. Back in the lab, Bizarro is now in a suit identical to Supergirl's and is made to watch Supergirl on TV while being shocked frequently. Max asks her what she thinks of Supergirl, to which she responds by saying Supergirl is bad, a result of his brainwashing methods, and pledges to kill her. During her date with Adam, Kara sees a news report of a stranded tram, prompting her to bail. Atop the tram, she is confronted by Bizarro, who ignores her questions and attacks her. During their fight, Bizarro's cheek cracks like porcelain and they break the tram's support, causing it to fall. Supergirl catches it, while Bizarro watches in slight puzzlement. J'onn and Alex formulate a plan to subdue Bizarro with Kryptonite. Adam meets Kara at CatCo and asked her out for another date that night. Winn finds out there are seven comatose Jane Does brought to Prometheus Genetics, owned by Maxwell Lord. Back at his lab, Max examines Bizarro, clearing up her broken skin. Bizarro is confused as Max said Supergirl is bad, yet she saved people, but Max is able to persuade her to attack Supergirl again. Alex goes to Max, saying she knew what he's up to. He indirectly confesses to his experiments, having obtained Kara's DNA from the arm of Red Tornado and flooded the comatose girl that became Bizarro with a concentrated infusion of the DNA. Threatening Alex to not reveal his operations, insinuating that he knows that they are family, he proclaimed "May the best girl win!". Meanwhile, Kara expressed dislike at using kryptonite weapons against Bizarro as she was just a victim of Max's project, but J'onn was reluctant to arrest Max since the D.E.O had no legal jurisdiction to do so and was meant to be out of public awareness. Alex convinces Kara to go on her date. Winn and James share a drink over their romantic troubles. On their date, Adam and Kara discuss their parentage, and Kara said it's hard for her to feel normal, but Adam said no one feels normal and they kiss. Suddenly, Bizarro swoops down and drags Kara away. They fight and Bizarro gains the upper hand until Alex shows up with and vehicles armed with kryptonite bullets. They fire at Bizarro, though it does not seem to injure her, but instead causes her biological structure to mutate and decay. She is left with her old face, but her eyes are again pure black and her skin is pale grey and covered in porcelain-like cracks. Bizarro screams at Supergirl that she hates her before flying off while the kryptonite ammunition prevented the latter from pursuing. Kara realizes that Bizarro came after her in her civilian identity and deduced Max knew her secret identity. Alex notes Bizarro having some of Supergirl's powers in reverse, leading J'onn to conclude that the chemical opposite of kryptonite may be able to harm her, which they plan on creating by revering the ionic charge of their own lab-made kryptonite. Kara stated they need to stop Max once and for all. Back at CatCo, Kara breaks up with Adam, citing she didn't have room in her life for him. At his lab, Max commands Bizarro, whose chest symbol is now reverse and suit is darkened, to attack Kara's loved ones. James tries to comfort Kara, but she wants to be alone. Alex orders D.E.O. agents to arrest Max. He threatened to reveal Supergirl's secret identity, but she slams him on a desk and stated no one would hear him. At CatCo, James hears someone fly over to him and thinks it is Kara, but it turns out to be Bizarro who kidnapped him. Max was brought to the D.E.O. and J'onn berates Alex for bringing him in, but Alex counters he of all people should understand her desire to protect her family. James wakes up tied up in a deserted warehouse, his signal watch broken off. When he tries to reach for the pieces, Bizarro warns him not to move, saying that she knew Kara loved him because they are the same. He asks her to come closer but she refuses, calling herself ugly. He begins to tell her that everyone sometimes feels ugly or feel that no one loves them or ever will. However, James assures that a part of her is still Supergirl and proceeds to tell her that everyone doesn't love Supergirl for what she looks like on the outside, but instead love her for who she is and in the process finally admits and realizes his true feelings; he loves Kara. However, when he reaches for the watch again, Bizarro lost her temper, calling him a liar and breathing fire at him, but not before he activated it with his foot. Kara hears him and she locates him while Alex brought bullets with blue kryptonite heads. Supergirl and Bizarro fought again and the latter tried to strangle Supergirl. Alex finally gets a clear shot and the bullet knocked Bizarro unconscious. In the D.E.O., J'onn tells Kara that Bizarro had been asking for her. Very weak and lying on a medical bed, she apologized to Kara and Kara said she's sorry too. J'onn says they are going to put her under, the way she was before being resuscitated and Kara comforts her saying she went to sleep for a long time once, but when she woke up, she wasn't alone, reassuring Bizarro that she wouldn't be alone either. J'onn and Kara agree to try and help her while she is comatose. Kara goes to Max's cell, saying he would never hurt anyone again, but Max cheerfully mentions her mother and the house they lived in. When Kara's eyes glow with heat vision, Alex enters and calms her down, saying he wasn't worth it. At CatCo, Cat tells Kara that Adam is leaving for Opal City. Cat confesses that she prioritized herself over Adam before, and that Kara was more like her and she thought. She also states that she wanted their relationship to go back to being strictly professional. Kara suggests to James that they go to the bar and talk about what happened when he was with Bizarro, but he says it was nothing and that he had to pick up Lucy from the airport. Kara flies back to her apartment and notices an eerie, gooey plant sprawled over the table. While she is distracted, a tentacled creature known as a black mercy, previously lurking out of sight on the ceiling lunges down at her.</div>

        <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 13: "For the Girl Who Has Everything"</h1>
        <div class="box">Kara woke up on a bed and was surprised by Kelex, who introduced itself as her medical attendant. Kara was confused by her surroundings. Alura Zor-El appeared, and when Kara questioned how she could be there, she said she's been staying with her while she recovered from "Argo fever". Kara refused to believe it, but Alura tells her she must have had hallucinations due to her illness. Kara looked out the window and was shocked to find herself on Krypton. Back in CatCo, Cat Grant demanded to know Kara's whereabouts. Winn Schott offered that the current solar storm may be interfering with phone signals. Cat determined that Kara was avoiding her due to her causing Adam Foster to leave the city. James Olsen had no idea what happened to her either, and the two mutually agreed to get Alex Danvers. Alex told them Kara was not on D.E.O. business, and when they asked if she brought a key to Kara's apartment, she broke down the door instead. They found Kara lying on the floor unconscious, an alien plant gripping her chest. Alex called in the D.E.O. and Kara was transported to the D.E.O. headquarters.

          J'onn J'onzz was displeased that Alex brought Winn and James and ordered them to be taken out, but not before James vowed to come back if anything happened to Kara and J'onn said he won't stop him. Alex interrogated Max, who apparently did not have any idea about Kara's condition. J'onn pulled Alex off him when she became increasingly frustrated, saying Max is a survivor and he'd spill everything to save himself, but warned Max if they find out he's lying, he'll let Alex come back, alone.

          The Kryptonians prepared for the next phase of their mission - "Myriad". Non revealed he had incapacitated Kara with "Black Mercy", thus technically did not disobey Astra's order for her to be unharmed, but she was displeased regardless. J'onn and Alex attempted to rip off the plant with a titanium claw, but this sent Kara into violent convulsions. Alex was forced to stop the extraction when Kara briefly flatlined. They realized they cannot remove it by force without killing her.

          Kara in her dream panicked as she did not have her powers or understand what's happening. She was distracted by a carving she made for Zor-El when she was eight, but was conflicted over her memory of leaving Krypton as well. She was determined to get to the bottom of the mystery and go home. Winn was very worried of Kara, especially after what happened between them not long before, but James assured him she's going to be fine. They tried and failed to cover for her and Cat threatened to fire her in one hour.

          Alex convinced J'onn to masquerade as Kara, but he had great difficulty fulfilling her difficulties and said Cat made him miss his prison. Alex attempted to get answers from the Alura AI in D.E.O. but the AI did not have information to share on the alien species, despite Alex's emotional outburst, when she admitted how she used to resent Kara.

          Kara in her dream became more and agitated and struggled to remember Earth, while Alura dismissed it as a "primitive planet" she would never send her to. She ran through the halls but came across Zor-El along with Alura. She ran back to her room where they reappeared together. Reminiscing about a piece of furniture she cracked when playing with her aunt, she found herself face to face with Astra, which caused her to become upset and blame her and Non for trapping her in the dream. Zor-El told her Non has been sent to the Phantom Zone long ago, yet she insisted she fought both of them recently, but to her horror, she could not recall Earth any more, and could only recall glimpses of her flying. Astra told her they only fly in their dreams, but Kara said that she had friends and family to protect. She was finally distracted and placated by Kal-El, who asked her to open an intricate orb, and she did with familiarity. The orb opens a large holographic display of the cosmos. Kal-El pointed out Krypton and Kara quietly agreed with him that it is beautiful.

          Alex was looking at a photo of her and Kara in the latter's apartment when she noticed Astra standing behind her in the mirror. She turned - allowing the framed photo to shatter on the ground - and shot Astra several times to predictably no effect. Astra quickly subdued her with a chokehold before explaining she came to help Kara, not fight, and releases Alex. Astra then informs her that the creature that latched onto Kara is a telepathic parasite called "Black Mercy". It had trapped her in a hallucinated fantasy life that was becoming more and more real and can only be broken out of by Kara rejecting it herself. Astra told Alex she could help Kara, but Alex had a hard time trusting her. Astra noticed the family photos and Alex admitted she is Kara's sister, and Astra pleaded her not to let her hatred blind her. In the secret room at CatCo, J'onn brushed off inquiries of him shapeshifting into Kara, and was resistant to Alex's plan to enter Kara's mind due to its dangers. James and Winn were both concerned of what would happen to Kara after they pulled her out of her perfect fantasy. J'onn began to understand why Kara values them and allowed Alex to take them to D.E.O. while he dealt with Cat.

          At Cat's office, J'onn, once again in Kara's form, apologizes to Cat, and while he was unaware of Kara's fling with Adam, decided to roll with it. Cat didn't buy it one bit and acidly told "Kara" to take the day off.
          
          J'onn arrived back to the D.E.O. and warned Alex that the Kryptonians could predict the solar storms and the timing of the attack on Kara cannot be coincidental. Alex had agents bring Max out of his cell for help, as the VR tech would otherwise take days to become functional. Max attempted to bargain, but Alex convinced him pointing out the Kryptonians are his enemies as well. Non and Astra briefed their soldiers, armed with anti-kryptonite suits, about their campaign they fought for on Krypton, now to be completed on Earth. After they left, Non questions Astra's whereabouts prior and her dedication to their war. Astra tensely affirmed it, and he apologized and left.

          At the D.E.O., Alex privately asked James to stop J'onn from pulling Alex back before she could save her sister, knowing that J'onn would do so at the first sign of trouble. Max casually brags about his brilliance in finishing the VR helmet and flippantly said he's not sure whether it will work.

          Alex wakes up on Krypton, in the chamber where Alura sentenced Astra and Non to the Phantom Zone. An agent informs J'onn the D.E.O. satellites are offline and Winn suggested Non and the Kryptonians may have planned to use those satellites for their own schemes.

          Alex moved through the halls on Krypton with an alien weapon until she found the chamber in which Kara's family were talking about her performance in court and interest in a Kryptonian man Del-Or. Kara has no memory of her sister when the latter tried to tell her what was really happening, and insisted she's home. Turning and nodding to her mother, Kara suddenly grabbed the sculpture from before and knocked Alex out. In the real world, Alex started to twitch and J'onn ordered Max to pull her out, but James stopped him, leading to an argument between J'onn and James. James knew J'onn did not want to lose either of his "daughters", but insisted that Alex would always find a way and asked him to trust her. When Alex regained consciousness in Kara's hallucination, she had been taken back to the Phantom Zone chamber and handcuffed. Alura announced the High Council's verdict was to banish her to the Phantom Zone. Alex begged Kara to listen, and that they would be trapped in the hallucination until the Black Mercy killed them. Zor-El told Kara they would be able to be happy again once she was gone. Alex told Kara that she understand her loss but she knew deep down this was not real, and tried to fight free of the guards holding her while earthquakes shook the chamber. Kara hesitantly admitted she wanted so much for this life to be true, and finally rejects the hallucination, telling Alura that she taught her to be strong, but she told her she would never let her leave. Falling to the ground from another quake, Kara and Alex reached out to each other. Alex woke with a start in the real world, and was outraged that her chance to save Kara was literally ripped away from her fingertips. Winn calmed her down, pointing out Kara was waking up while the Black Mercy slipped off her. Kara sat up but her expression was blank as she got off the table she was on. After a few long seconds, she demanded to know who did it to her, and asked for Non's location when Alex told her of the culprit. At the main chamber of the D.E.O. headquarters, Winn told the group he found some hidden transmissions that used Lord-based servers based on the same lab the Kryptonians attacked before, and they left a virus that allowed them to override normal control. J'onn sent out teams to Max's other similar labs while Kara told him she would handle Non.

Kara tackled Non was he was attaching something to a satellite dish and furiously pummeled him screaming about how he took her world away from her and thought he could do the same to Earth (strangely, Non hardly fight back), but Non still managed to activate his device. Astra was similarly distracted by Alex, who was shot out of the sky by her heat vision. Astra insisted she saved Kara out of her sense of duty, but Alex claimed her heart was not in the war any more because of her love for Kara, which causes Astra to force her over a ledge. Alex said she had plenty of chances to kill her or Kara but she had not because she didn't want to and asked her to help them instead, but they were interrupted by J'onn's (while Astra briefly thought it was Kara) arrival in Martian form. Astra expressed surprise at his survival as the last son of Mars and they battled each other. Kara and Non continued to fight and Non claimed Myriad will "cure" Earth of humanity. Astra managed to install her device before J'onn surprised her with his intangibility, grabbed her and flew them both into a building, where she overpowered him and attempted to kill him, but she was impaled from behind with a kryptonite blade by Alex. Non sabotaged the satellite dish and escaped while Kara caught it. Non eventually grew tired of Kara and blew her away with heat vision. Alex called Kara to her. J'onn claimed that he stabbed Astra as he saw no other way. Kara told Astra that in her hallucination, she saw her not as an enemy, but as family. When Astra died, Alex told Kara they had to leave as Kryptonians descended from the sky.

They took her body back to their base, and a soldier informed that the Myriad is operational and she did not die in vain.

At the D.E.O., J'onn hands one of the devices Kara retrieved to an agent for analysis. Alex informed him that two squads never reported, and that Kara was taking Astra's death badly. J'onn said that she never stopped hoping for Astra's redemption, and that's the difference between soldier and hero. Alex asked him why he lied about killing Astra, and he said it's because she's Kara's hero and he didn't want that to change. Kara returned to his apartment to find Alex, Winn and James waiting for her. She wanted to tell her about why she imagined herself on Krypton, despite James's protests - that she was feeling lost, but she knew she belonged here with her friends and family, topped off saying "there's no place like home", laughed and high-fived Winn when he said she quoted a movie and affirmed their friendship. James announced he brought both pot stickers and ice cream - Kara's favorite. Alex decided to tell Kara something - that J'onn tried to cover for her at work, and Kara guessed correctly that it didn't go well, but James told her to save it for tomorrow, whipping out a bottle of alcohol. Kara complained that she couldn't get drunk, but they overrode her and Alex said they will.</div>

<h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 14: "Truth, Justice, and the American Way"</h1>    
<div class="box">An unknown figure flew through the night skyline of National City.

  At home, Kara told Alex that she should probably go to bed with her missing work and all. Alex told her not to worried and hugged her. Kara admitted she missed Astra, and that she's almost getting through to her when she was killed. Alex was about to confess to killing Astra when they were interrupted by a noise by the window. Kara dismissed it as her being jumpy at first, but then Non announced his presence and asked Kara to come with him on behalf of Astra, which she agreed despite Alex's protests.

  Up in the sky, the funeral for Astra was held. Non told Kara he would hold a period for mourning, and vowed to kill her after it was over. At the D.E.O. headquarters, Kara told J'onn they have two weeks. After she left after Max demanded to see her, Alex told J'onn she could't lie to Kara about Astra's death any longer, but the latter insisted Alex was what Kara needed.

  At Max's cell, he bargained for parole due to his help in saving Kara from the Black Mercy. She calmly refused and cited how dangerous he was, until he started to lose his polite exterior and yelled that she would be dead if not for him, but she countered that without him, the world would be a better place. At CatCo, Kara was cheerfully informed by Cat Grant that she had hired a second assistant, Siobhan Smythe, and Kara was surprised Cat pronounced her name correctly. Cat designated Kara as "Assistant #2" to her confusion. Siobhan promptly one-upped Kara's coffee while Winn looked on uncomfortably. Cat told Siobhan to get James Olsen and Lucy Lane into her office and told Kara to cover the phone. Towards Winn, Kara feigned confidence over her rival and that she's not upset but Winn pointed out she just broke her phone, and walked away smiling in a slightly self-satisfied manner. Using her super hearing, Kara heard Cat revealing her theory that Max is missing. Cat dismissed Siobhan and told Lucy and James to investigate.

  James was about to talk to Kara but was interrupted by Siobhan, who tried to flatter him but was brushed off. When they were alone, James voiced his objection towards D.E.O.'s detainment of Max without due process. Kara told him it's not his place to worry about the D.E.O.'s ethics, but James said it's not D.E.O.'s ethics he's worried about. Siobhan saw them talking and walked away smirking. J'onn briefed D.E.O. agents about a Fort Rozz escapee who went by Gabriel Phillips. When they found him, he's been chained up and begged them to help him. An armored figure appeared, shrugging off fire and retaliating with energy blasts before taking off with the escapee in tow. Alex told J'onn he was abducted.

  Alex and J'onn discuss the mysterious personality when Kara came in, asking why they didn't call her. When J'onn said he thought she needed some time off, she bluntly retorted that she would request it if she needed it. They were unable to determine the attacker's identity or motive. The armored figure was shown holding the alien prisoner, saying his human disguise could not fool him and demanded him to show his true form. He activated a guillotine despite the alien's protest that Krypton has no death penalty, as they were not on Krypton, and the alien transformed, asking to leave. He was told that "No one escapes the Master Jailer" and was executed.

  J'onn and Alex went to the police in search for leads. One of the detectives apparently disliked Supergirl. An officer apprehensively told them there were at least five more cases of kidnappings that ended in decapitation, and that the victims were "weird" including one with gills. At CatCo, Siobhan was eyeing Kara from her desk and decided to send her a message asking what's between her and James. Kara asked what she meant and she boldly sent another asking whether they were dating or friends with benefits, which Kara denied, while Winn observed. Siobhan continued sending messages and upset her when she apparently accused her of being "obsessed" with James. Cat arrived and told her to keep it down. Alex called Kara, who said she's dealing with a problem right now, but Alex told her it couldn't wait. Before she left, she tried to remind Siobhan Cat's lunch, but Siobhan recited it perfectly and mocked her for not doing her job, winked at Winn and smirked at his uncomfortable reaction. Lucy showed James some car plates that she found out through her father that belonged to a secret government department that tracked aliens. James tried to dissuade Lucy from investigating further, closing the door on an eavesdropping Siobhan, but accidentally revealed he knew what the agency was - D.E.O. Lucy deduced that Supergirl told him about it, guessed he was even closer to Supergirl than Superman and stormed out.

  J'onn and Alex figured out that their opponent was killing Fort Rozz escapees by their prisoner number, making his next target prisoner #2445. Master Jailer confronted #2445, demanding him to show himself, and knocked him down when he attempted to flee before he was interrupted by Supergirl. Ignoring her question about his identity, he attacked her with chains, which she dodged by shooting into the air. They fought and Kara gained a slight upper hand. The Master Jailer managed to tangle her in chains, and by the time she burned her way out with heat vision, both him and the escapee has fled. James was drinking on the CatCo balcony when he was joined by Cat, who knew something was troubling him and shared her experience with troubles that were both work and personal - back at the Daily Planet, she was finally assigned to interview a rising star of an actor. Everyone told her he's great, but his wife's makeup artist revealed the bruises she had to cover up every morning. She caved to PR pressure and did not publish that, but three months later he shot his wife in the head and Cat's been haunted by what she could have done ever since. She said they do what they do because they wanted to be good people. James saw Siobhan just behind her. J'onn identified the Master Jailer's chains as of alien origin. He revealed #2445, real name Luzano, was a drug smuggler before Alura Zor-El put him away, which made Kara snap at him. Alex and J'onn decided to continue investigating, and James arrived wanting to talk to Kara. They argue further about Max's imprisonment and James pointed out people have a reason to fear her. When James questioned what kind of hero what she wanted to be, she replied she did what needs to be done, which greatly disappointed James. Kara asked whether Lucy told Cat about this, and James said Siobhan did.

  Alex beckoned for Kara to come out. The baton the Master Jailer used to knock down his quarry was standard police issue, and they identified the DNA as the detective who hated Supergirl, Warren. The two detectives were driving and discussing the missing aliens when they were stopped by Supergirl. Kara and Alex confronted Warren, who claimed to be one of the good guys. Detective Draper said he was telling the truth and shot both Alex and Warren. With a raise of his fist, his Master Jailer armor appeared over him. Alex was protected by her bulletproof vest, but he took Kara. Kara found herself in a cage without her powers, while Luzano pointed out the artificial red sun radiation that was suppressing her powers. He declined to answer why he was in Fort Rozz at first, but then talked about his past leading to how he tried to get into drug smuggling for his ailing wife but was caught on his first run. When Fort Rozz landed on Earth, he only wanted a good life and taught his students about the stars, which reminded Kara of Astra. Kara promised to get them out of here, but the Master Jailer appeared and said she would not. Alex told J'onn they only have twelve hours between Master Jailer's kidnappings and executions. Alex said they couldn't find a match in the prisoner files which may have been corrupted in the crash, but realized he was a guard. The D.E.O. apparently located him.

  The Master Jailer told Kara he was continuing Alura's vision of justice, and prepared to execute Luzano. Kara begged him not to do it and he realized he would have to kill her too.
  
  The D.E.O. searched the cabin where he was supposed to be, but found no one.
  
  Luzano asked the Master Jailer to let Kara go, but he denied the request. Alex noticed strange glowing from under the floor, pried the boards open and discovered Master Jailer's ship far below.

  Kara asked Luzano to look at her but he was resigned to his fate. D.E.O. agents blew up the top of Master Jailer's ship and attacked him. He gained the upper hand and forced Alex onto the guillotine, but she fired more shots into the ceiling, allowing yellow sunlight to shine in and recharge Kara, who fought and finally defeated the Master Jailer. Luzano asked what they're going to do with him. Kara brought him back to his school, saying he's served his sentence and he had students to teach.

  Alex and Kara released Max from his cell and told him he's free to go. Kara tried to appeal to his better nature to his amazement. Once Kara left, Alex threatened him to never reveal their secrets or they would reveal his crimes. At CatCo, Siobhan smugly told Kara she finished all her work for her. Fed up, Kara bluntly said she didn't like Siobhan, but Siobhan retorted she wasn't there to make friends, but to be the next Cat Grant. Siobhan detailed her massive ambitions, dismissively stating that Kara will be her own personal assistant one day. Undeterred, Kara challenged that they'd see which one of them gets to stay.

  Kara thanked James for making her a better hero, and he returned the sentiment. He said he would need to tell Lucy the truth about Supergirl's identity if they are going to stay together and asked for Kara's permissions. He left when Kara didn't respond. Kara told Alura's AI about Luzano and how they had helped him in a strange way. She also asked about the "Myriad" project Non and Astra were working on, but the AI warned it was not authorized to discuss it and further questions will result in self-destruction. J'onn deactivated the AI. Kara said the hologram used to remind her of her mother, but now she could only think of Astra and how J'onn supposedly killed her. Kara walked out, saying she didn't know how to work with him or the D.E.O. any more.</div>

<h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 15: "Solitude"</h1>
<div class="box">In a flashback to her past, the young Kara Zor-El wakes in the Phantom Zone and notices a computer console in her dashboard that lights up with a logo with three dots in a triangular shape. Her pod and Fort Rozz's engines activate, traveling to Earth.

  In the present day, Alex brings Kara breakfast to entice her to come back to the D.E.O., but Kara declines because she's still coping with Hank "killing" Astra. Kara heads off to CatCo, where she and Winn once again endure a condescending Siobhan, before being interrupted by Cat asking everyone to attend a conference call. Siobhan shows Cat a package that she should see personally, but Cat wants it open for all to see. James takes the package and opens it to find a thumb drive from Diamond Discretions, an affairs website, and a letter imploring Cat to release the names. Lucy points out many of the people are public figures but Cat refuses to do an anonymous person's bidding. She tells Siobhan to have the drive "microwaved". At the D.E.O., Alex and Hank spar and debate over whether Kara should know the truth, and Hank briefly reverts into his Martian form before changing back in an intense moment. He insisted that D.E.O. will continue to function without Kara and revealing the truth will only cause more pain, despite that he didn't want to lose her either. Back at CatCo, James reminds Kara about how he needs to tell Lucy her secret, but Kara says her life is already too complicated and dangerous, before Lucy walks in, conveniently mistaking that their conversation is about the thumb drive and stating that there's nothing she hates more than liars. Just then, the monitors and other electronic devices start to go haywire. A blonde woman appears on all of the screens. She tells Cat that she ignored what was on the drive, and warns her that she will bring chaos to National City. Cat orders Winn to fix the systems. The hacker starts disrupting the traffic signals. Kara, as Supergirl, arrives to prevent a potentially catastrophic accident just in time.

  The city begins to panic. Cat tells Siobhan to call her investment broker, but she stammers for a moment before Kara takes the assignment. Cat tells James to get every reporter on this latest cyber attack, but as James prepares to cover the story, Lucy is not pleased because Supergirl is involved. At Kara's apartment, Kara and James watch Winn try to crack the code to no avail when the hacker appears on the screen. Suddenly, she teleports through the computer into the room as a blue woman with a three-dot symbol on her head. As she attacks, Kara is suddenly joined by Hank and Alex, causing the woman to retreat back into the computer. They try to persuade Kara to come back to the D.E.O. because they have the information on the computer. However, Kara is not ready to return. The cyberwoman teleports through another computer, scares a couple off and meets with Non, who is still grieving over Astra's death. Now calling herself Indigo, she tells Non that Astra's notion of living alongside the humans can't work, and vows to change that so she and the Kryptonians can be only ones left on Earth.

  Back at CatCo, Winn helps Siobhan with the copy machine, but she is upset over finding that her father was listed as a member of Diamond Discretions thanks to Indigo and leaves him to make the copies.
  
  Alex later stops by to ask Winn to help with disabling the malware, which upsets Kara. The frustration prompts James to take Kara to Superman's Fortress of Solitude. After Kara opens the door with a million-ton key, they find a number of artifacts, including Kal-El's pod. James expresses surprise that Kal-El never brought her to the fortress, and Kara explains she always refused because she thought the base would remind her too much of home. When she touched a terminal, Kelex appears and when questioned, tells Kara that she is looking for a Coluan. Indigo was a descendant of Brainiac and a prisoner at Fort Roz for attempted genocide and is considered the deadliest of the escaped prisoners. James thinks Hank should know, but Kara was adamantly against it, saying she isn't in this fight alone. When James returns, Lucy is upset that he forgot a dinner date and storms off to tell her father about Indigo hacking the military systems. Kara then intervenes and tries to calm down Lucy about James. Kara tells Lucy about James' father, but Lucy notes that James never told her the story about his first camera and the conversation ends on an uncomfortable note.

  Kara admits she misses the partnership she had with Alex and Winn. Lucy theorizes that the attack on the cheating site was actually aimed at a single person—a general who is in charge of a secret nuclear site. They quickly realize that Indigo wants to take over the site and use it to launch nuclear missiles at National City.
  
  At the D.E.O., Winn attempts to track Indigo. Alex wishes Kara was there to help. The two teams simultaneously close in onto Indigo's true plan to destroy the city. At the military site, Indigo has found her way into the base through the general's phone, and takes out everyone. Kara arrives to fight Indigo, but is forced to abandon the fight when Indigo activates a missile. She attempts to push it off course, but it simply adjusts its path and continued to fly towards National City. Kara tells James there is no time to evacuate. James warns using her heat vision to destroy the missile may cause it to detonate, prompting her to consult Hank, who guides and helps Kara disarm the missile with a kill code, shutting it off and allowing to plummet harmlessly into the ocean. Indigo attempts to launch more missiles before Kara returns to stop her. Winn is about to infect Indigo with a virus that will disable her. Realizing what is happening, Indigo teleports her arm through a phone screen and begins choking him. The virus is effective, and as Indigo lays helpless in front of Kara, she reveals that she was the one who connected both Kara's pod and Fort Rozz which bought them to Earth, then disintegrates. At CatCo, Winn comforts Siobhan and tells her about his family, and how he has felt betrayed just like her. Siobhan then kisses him but warns Winn not to say anything. Meanwhile, Kara gives James her blessing to tell Lucy the truth, only to have Lucy tell James that she is breaking up with him; Lucy believes that Kara loves James too, even if she can't admit it yet. Kara returns to the D.E.O. and is ready to work with Hank again, admitting the conflict with Indigo could've been solved sooner otherwise. Alex suddenly comes clean to Kara and confesses to killing Astra in order to protect J'onn, but let him take the blame because she didn't want to lose her sister. Although initially shocked, Kara forgives her. While Kara and a crying Alex embrace, Kara reaches out to hold Hank's hand in a silent apology, which he accepts.

Finally, Non, places a mysterious spinning sphere on a console where a new version of Indigo begins to materialize, but in pieces. Non declares that he wants her to do things his way now.</div>

<h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 16: "Falling"</h1>
<div class="box">Cat appears on CBS The Talk to discuss her relationship with Supergirl, and goes out of her way to praise her. Kara hears a little girl wearing a Supergirl outfit being bullied. She flies down to them, calls her a friend, using X-ray vision to find out her name, to the other kids' amazement. Kara was watching the show when Cat interrupts, reflecting on how well it went. She wants to speak with Winn, and sends Kara to find him. Kara thinks he's hiding in the storeroom, but when she uses her X-ray vision, she discovers him making out with Siobhan. Cat tells Kara that Lucy has quit. When she goes to James he said she broke up with him before he had a chance to tell her that Kara is Supergirl, but denies the break up as having anything to do with Kara or Supergirl.

  Alex and Kara discuss the issue. Kara says she feels guilty and that she doesn't want to be a rebound girl. Alex attempts to make her feel better and cites "Kim and Kanye" to Kara's embarrassment. Miranda Crane comes to the D.E.O. to personally congratulate Hank, Alex and Kara for their efforts to fight alien threats. She plans to lobby for greater funding for their agency. She holds Hank's hand for a brief moment, which doesn't go unnoticed by the sisters. Kara flies out to help a fireman trapped by debris in a fire. She manages to lift the debris off of him. As she is about to leave, she staggers briefly, her face suddenly having glowing red veins, which quickly vanish. Shrugging it off, she flies off, not seeing the glowing red object underneath nearby debris. The next day, Kara smashes her alarm clock and arrives for work at CatCo wearing somewhat more stylish attire than normal. Cat wanted Siobhan to search for replacements for Lucy, but Kara has already taken care of it, and was rewarded with a couple of club tickets. Later that day, Hank briefs the D.E.O. team on a gang of bank robbers who have turned to a Fort Rozz escapee, a K'hund, for added strength, though Kara does not seem interested and behaved flippantly. That night, the D.E.O. engages the K'hund and, as planned, they lure him toward Kara to finish him off. Kara easily gets the better of him, crushing his hand and stepping on his throat. However, she lets him go, saying he isn't worthy of her time. Hank and Alex know this isn't like Kara, but when they confront her, Kara lays into Hank for hiding his identity, saying every Kryptonian on the planet other than her cousin wants her dead. She walks out, and out of everyone's sight, violently punches a wall. The next day, Kara arrives at the office in Cat's elevator, which shocks Winn, but Cat brushes it off. Siobhan reveals that she managed to get footage of Supergirl letting the K'hund escape. She tries to pitch it to Cat, but Cat isn't interested. Alex manages to recapture the K'hund, who reveals Supergirl let him go.

Undaunted by Cat's rejection, Siobhan plans to sell the story to her old employer, the Daily Planet. However, Kara picks up her plotting with her super hearing, and lures Siobhan away from her desk long enough to print a copy of the email. When Cat learns about Siobhan's treachery, she fires Siobhan on the spot. She additionally made sure Siobhan would never get any work with Daily Planet either. Obviously crushed, Siobhan leaves the scene as Winn tries to comfort her and Kara mocked her. Kara invites Winn and James to celebrate at a club. Kara arrives late, and persuades James to dance with her. She tries to come on to James, and trashes Lucy in the process. James realize that Kara isn't herself. Cat calls James and asks to see Supergirl.

Supergirl later flies to CatCo, and tells Cat she's no longer interested in being a hero. To prove her point, she hurls Cat over the balcony, and flies down to catch her just in time.

James and Winn alert Hank and Alex about the changes in Kara. Hank cross-references Kara's last missions, and discovers the red substance at the fire site. Alex deduces that it is a form of synthetic Kryptonite from its radiation signature. Maxwell then arrives and admits it was his creation. While Maxwell is in custody, he reveals that the substance was Red Kryptonite. He created it in hopes of stopping Non's next attack—only to find out that it backfired disastrously and turned Supergirl bad by destroying her inner inhibitions. He does, however, offer to make an antidote. Cat reluctantly goes on air to declare that she can no longer stand behind Supergirl. Alex tracks Kara to her apartment, and finds Kara wearing a black uniform similar to what Astra, Non and their army wear. Kara lays into Alex, pouring out years of resentment. Alex warns her that she isn't herself. However, Kara is now mad with power, and says she feels freer than she ever did. Vowing to make those who don't already worship her do so, she flies off. Senator Crane convinces the D.E.O. that Supergirl is now a threat. Reluctantly, Hank dispatches a team to track down Kara. Maxwell finishes his antidote, and loads it in an energy gun for Alex. The D.E.O. arrives to find Kara wreaking havoc on National City. Alex tries to talk some sense into Kara, but Kara violently attacks Alex. Seeing Alex in danger, Hank turns into J'onn J'onzz and engages Kara, distracting her long enough for Alex to fire the antidote. Hank is taken into custody. Kara comes to, and is horrified at what she did under Red Kryptonite's influence; she couldn't stop it. A small relief was that she didn't kill anyone. Alex admits there was some truth to what Kara said, but promises to work on it. Imprisoned, Hank tells Senator Crane that he is J'onn J'onzz, and refuses to answer whether he killed the real Hank Henshaw. Crane feels betrayed and walks out. Alex wonders why Hank didn't run, but Hank said he would do anything to keep Alex and Kara safe.

Kara tries to apologize to James, but James needs some space for a while. Later, as Supergirl, Kara offers to apologize to Cat, but Cat tells her that she needs to win back National City's trust first.</div>

<h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 17: "Manhunter"</h1>
<div class="box">At her apartment, sullen Kara Danvers watched a KPJT News report on her failed bank intervention from the morning, with everyone fleeting when she arrived. At CatCo Worldwide Media, Cat Grant held a meeting during which she complained about the citizens of National City's reluctance to forgive Supergirl, and the spiraling crime rate. Afterwards, she called for Kara though Winn had to remind her that Kara was out sick for the day. Winn then offered to man the phones, though he had to leave, as he was texted by Siobhan Smythe who asked him to meet her at Noonan's, leaving James to answer the phones.

  At Noonan's, Siobhan tells Winn that she has been blacklisted; she can't even get an interview once she reveals who she is. She blames Kara, but Winn believes Siobhan will be back on her feet.
  
  Meanwhile, at the D.E.O., Alex visits J'onn, who warns her to cut back on her visits given the near-certainty of a government investigation. J'onn's warning proves accurate; Alex is summoned to the main room to find a battery of soldiers have taken over headquarters. Their commander, Marine Colonel James Harper, is leading an investigation into J'onn's infiltration of the D.E.O. Lucy Lane has returned to the JAG Corps as a legal assistant in the investigation. The two take J'onn to an interrogation room that is protected with a stasis field so powerful that J'onn can't use his powers even if he wanted to. It also prevents Kara from listening in.
  
  Inside the room, J'onn tells the two about what happened when he befriended Jeremiah Danvers ten years earlier in Peru. The real Hank Henshaw led a D.E.O. team to Peru to hunt down a dangerous alien fugitive they have been hunting for years. Jeremiah was against this; he thought they could learn something from the Manhunter. However, Hank wouldn't hear of it.
  
  During the mission, a snake attacks Jeremiah, but J'onn saves him. That night, the two bonded and became friends. Jeremiah realized that J'onn is an alien refugee - just like his adopted daughter, Kara. J'onn explained that he had a family as well - including daughters - until they were killed on his home planet of Mars, leaving him the sole survivor. Jeremiah promises to help him and inform the D.E.O. that he wasn't a threat. Just then, Hank appears and shoots J'onn. Jeremiah comes to J'onn's defense, leading to a scuffle between Jeremiah and Hank. As they fight, Hank stabs Jeremiah, mortally wounding him. Jeremiah throws Hank over a cliff to his death. Before he dies, Jeremiah asks J'onn to watch over his daughters - prompting J'onn to assume Hank's identity.
  
  Harper, who was close friends with Hank, doesn't believe J'onn means no harm, even when J'onn emphasizes that he helped protect Earth from numerous alien threats. Harper orders J'onn taken into custody over Alex and Kara's vociferous objections. Harper tells Alex she is next. Siobhan sneaks into CatCo Plaza and slips behind Kara's desk. She then sends a nasty email to Cat, on Kara's account.
  
  Alex is polygraphed by Lucy and Jim. She explained how J'onn as Hank approached her to join the D.E.O. three years ago. After a night of drinking and clubbing led to her arrest, Hank visited her in jail. Hank told Alex that she was special just like Kara, and that she owed it to her father to be the person he knew she could be. When asked if she knew beforehand that J'onn was posing as Hank, Alex says "no" - and passes. However, Lucy doesn't believe her and places her under arrest. After Kara slips on Vasquez's earphones so she can listen in, she is stunned that Lucy and Jim are taking the two to Project Cadmus.
  
  Kara tells James that J'onn and Alex have been taken into custody. James tells her that Project Cadmus is a genetic engineering facility where captured aliens are subjected to experiments. Superman is so opposed to it that he refuses to work with the government. This left Kara with no choice but to have James bring Lucy over to the apartment.
  
  When Lucy arrived, Kara reveals that she is Supergirl. Lucy is still distrusting of aliens, and doesn't understand why they lie. This is when Kara explained to Lucy why she kept her powers a secret for so long. 12 years ago, while hanging out on the beach with some friends on her first day at school, she heard an explosion from a burning car. Her instincts kicked in, and she pulled a woman and her baby out of the car just as it exploded; Alex was injured by flying debris. Afterwards, Jeremiah gives Kara a pair of glasses lined with a little lead to suppress her X-ray vision. He tells her that the world doesn't need another hero, and she shouldn't use her powers lest she endanger people.
  
  Years later, Kara starts her job as Cat's personal assistant. She tells Cat that she's not special, she just wants to be useful and is willing to meet Cat's demands for absolute loyalty and devotion. She tells Lucy that when you're an alien not living on your home world, you're willing to sacrifice everything just to fit in. She and James appeal to Lucy's better instincts.
  
  Later that night, a military truck en route to Project Cadmus is intercepted by two motorcycles. The guards open fire on one of the cyclists, but the bullets bounce off him harmlessly. The other cyclist shoots out the truck's tires. While Harper is distracted, Alex crushes the device that maintains the stasis field, allowing J'onn to break free and overpower Harper. The cyclists turn out to be Kara and Lucy. While Kara disarms the guards, J'onn erases Harper's memory of having remembered meeting him. However, he gets a glimpse inside Harper's mind and discovers that Jeremiah is alive at Cadmus. Alex tells Kara that she will go with J'onn to find Cadmus. Kara offers to hide Alex in the Fortress of Solitude while she finds Jeremiah, but Alex insists that she has to be the one to find him.
  
  Cat calls Siobhan in. Just as Siobhan thinks she's about to get her job back, Cat reveals that Winn analyzed the email Kara supposedly sent. Winn discovered that the typing pattern didn't match Kara at all - but it matched Siobhan. Cat brusquely orders Siobhan out, and threatens to call the police if she ever comes back again. Later on at the D.E.O., Vasquez informs Lucy that Harper has resigned - and at his insistence, Lucy has been named acting director. Upon being informed that a bank robbery is underway, Kara heads off to stop it. She doesn't know if National City will ever trust her, but Lucy says that if she can win her trust, she can win back the city.
  
  Winn finds a severely drunk Siobhan on the roof of a nearby building. Siobhan is furious at Winn for turning on her, even as he tells her that criminal and manipulative behavior won't get her anywhere. Suddenly, one of Siobhan's spike heels breaks, causing her to lose her balance and stumble off the roof. She screams in terror, but just as she is about to fall to her death, the sound waves from her screams break her fall and blow a hole in the concrete, while an equally stunned Winn watches.</div>

  <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl & The Flash Crossover: Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 18: "Worlds Finest"</h1>
  <div class="box">Back in Kara's office, Barry quickly learns that there is no S.T.A.R. Labs on this Earth. Winn and James join them and explain Siobhan left soon after Kara. Barry explains about the multiverse, how different Earths occupy the same space at different frequencies and how he accidentally went fast enough to pass through the barrier (in "Versus Zoom"). James is uncomfortable at Kara and Barry's sudden closeness, to Winn's amusement. They run into Cat, who has an image of the Flash rescuing Kara. Despite Barry(who the others claim is their cousin)'s protests to the contrary, she wants to name this new hero "the Blur".

    Siobhan meets her aunt Sinead, who runs a magic shop and quickly realizes what has happened to her. She explains that as a result of a curse by a banshee on one of their ancestors centuries ago, all the women in their family gain the power when someone wrongs them. If they don't kill the source of their anger, the power will grow until it destroys their souls. Siobhan knows Supergirl will protect Kara (unaware they are the same person) so decides to gain an ally. She uses her scream to break Livewire out of containment and Livewire easily overpowers the guards.
    
    Lucy informs Kara of the escape and she tries to get Cat to go into hiding but Cat is confident Supergirl will defeat Livewire. Kara goes to Barry for help and she and Winn take him to the DEO where he offers his CSI skills. Lucy also notes James' jealousy and tells him not to stay away from Kara because of her. Livewire meets Siobhan at an abandoned warehouse where Siobhan suggests they team up to kill Cat, Supergirl and Kara. Livewire says Siobhan will need a makeover first. Barry is able to use the atmospheric disturbance to track Livewire. He wants to come up with a plan first but Supergirl insists they need to contain Livewire quickly. She and the Flash head to the warehouse to find not only Livewire but Siobhan, now costumed and made up and calling herself Silver Banshee. The Flash's use of his powers merely charges Livewire up and causes her to knock him down, while Silver Banshee's scream leaves Supergirl's ears bleeding. Despite making a few hits of their own, the heroes have to retreat.

    Kara apologises to Barry for going in without a plan, explaining she's trying hard to make up for recent mistakes. Barry says these things take time. Livewire and Silver Banshee turn up at CatCo, where Livewire stops James summoning Supergirl and Silver Banshee rejects Winn's attempts to reason with her. Back at the DEO, Barry has made some ear buds to block Silver Banshee's powers. Lucy tells him and Supergirl that Cat has been kidnapped. Livewire and Silver Banshee have Cat chained up in the park where Cat begs Livewire not to kill her and leave her boys with nothing. Supergirl and the Flash arrive and the ear buds do their work, protecting them from Silver Banshee. Livewire and the Flash fight on a rooftop and Livewire triumphs, while Supergirl frees Cat and confronts Silver Banshee. Livewire tries to blast down a helicopter above them and Supergirl blocks the electricity with her body but is badly injured. Showing she has regained the city's trust, the bystanders move to shield Supergirl and a fire crew turn their hoses on Livewire, shorting out both her and Silver Banshee. Kara tells James and Winn that Barry has given National City Police Department some advice on dealing with meta-humans, meaning Livewire and Silver Banshee are now in their hands, noting James once said her enemies deserved a fair trial. She asks Cat for permission to go and see off Barry; Cat has already guessed he is the Flash. Supergirl meets him and he suggests they combine their speeds to push him across the dimensional barrier. He also gives her advice on James. They both race across the landscape, and the Flash vanishes into a dimensional breach.

    That evening, Kara calls James to her apartment and kisses him, only for him to walk out in a trance, along with other people in the building. A Kryptonian reports to Non that Myriad has been activated: Non notes first National City and then the whole Earth will be theirs. Kara watches in horror as the entire city walks through the streets in a trance.</div>

    <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 19: "Myriad"</h1>
    <div class="box">At the D.E.O., the entire compound are now under the influence of the Myriad project, which has also taken over National City. Non uses the mind control to order Lucy to release all of the prisoners except for the White Martian.Maxima, a prisoner who had feelings for Superman at one point - allies with Non as his new partner. When she attempts to make her escape, Kara arrives and tries to stop her, but Lucy uses a kryptonite bullet to slow her down.

      However, Kara does destroy the computer terminal after using the afterburners from her ship to knock out the mind-controlled DEO members and prevent the prisoners from escaping. After removing the bullet, she flies to the Fortress of Solitude to find her cousin Superman, but Kelex tells Kara that he is not on Earth and refuses to inform Kara about Myriad. She then turns to the image of Alura, who explains that Myriad was a mind-control system Astra and Non were arrested for trying to use against the people of Krypton; Kara learns from Alura that once Myriad is in effect it can't be stopped.
      
      Back in National City, Kara is noticing everyone, even Winn and James, are now under the Myriad effect and watching Kryptonian codes on the screen, General Lane has placed the entire city under quarantine, but Kara informs him that she will help save his daughter. Cat arrives at her office, but is not affected by Myriad. Kara then gets a text from Clark to help her immediately. When she goes to look out the window, Superman arrives, but unfortunately becomes mind-controlled as well.
      
      Kara then notices Maxwell entering with a headset that protects him from Myriad, and that the earrings that Cat is now wearing also protected her from Myriad. Maxwell tells Kara and Cat that Non is using his satellites to control the humans but Maxwell's real goal is to kill all Kryptonians. A move echoed by Indigo, who wants to kill Supergirl once and for all. Non believes that bringing the people of Earth together to save the world will save the world from Krypton's fate, but Kara believes he betrayed Astra for doing this, so Non forces the CatCo employees to turn on Supergirl and makes three of them to jump to their deaths, Supergirl immediately rescues Winn and James, but is too late to save a woman nearby. A mind-controlled James and Winn tell her to accept defeat or die. Meanwhile, Alex and J'onn, posing as mother and son so they can elude authorities, arrive at Eliza's home, where after a moment to calm her down (as J'onn transformed to prove he wasn't Hank), reveal the truth about Jeremiah being alive. Eliza then informs the two about National City under quarantine and turns on the television. After a conversation over what happened and looking at pictures of Jeremiah and his daughters, J'onn gains the trust of Eliza and promises to keep an eye on Kara and Alex. Alex then gets a call from Kara, who asks about Project Cadmus, but Alex wants to return to National City to help. Kara, on the other hand, hangs up on Alex, warning her not to come or she'll be under Myriad.

      J'onn, however, agrees with Kara, and since he is not affected by Myriad, tells Alex to stay behind while he goes back to National City because her father still needs her, but later on and without explaining this to Eliza, both Alex and J'onn return to National City. When they return, Indigo is ready and waiting for the twosome as they're lured into a battle, with J'onn almost gaining the upper hand. Indigo managed to come back and attack J'onn and grabbing Alex. Indigo then orders a weakened J'onn to stand down or she'll kill Alex, and he does that, only to collapse, as Indigo is convinced that J'onn, being the last surviving Green Martian, has died.
      
      Maxwell has come up with a plan to drop a Kryptonite bomb on the city, but at the risk of killing both Kryptonians and residents, which is given the green light by General Lane under the orders of the President. Despite going along with his plan, Supergirl is receiving opposition from Cat, as Maxwell demands to know whether she's with him or not. Supergirl asks Maxwell what made him who he is now and he tells her that he knew what was going to happen to his parents, but nobody listened to him, telling her that now he rushes in just the way she does when she suits up.
      
      Cat is still upset with Supergirl for going along with Maxwell, believing that everyone is letting their fear guide them, but someone has to find the courage to stand up, adding that Supergirl inspires everyone to take a stand. This convinces Supergirl to come up with an idea. When the two arrive at Lord Technologies to convince Maxwell not to go through with the bomb but by now has begun preparing to launch it, Maxwell doesn't want to listen to their offer, but Supergirl uses his feelings about his parents by convincing him to honor them as well as hers by making a choice that won't involve weapons.
      
      Back at Non's secret location, he and Indigo are ready to greet Alex from having been conscious for hours, as Non tell her that he wanted her to be awake so that he could see her suffer the same way Astra died. Despite Alex telling Non that Astra lost her taste for Myriad at the end, he isn't convinced and Indigo suggests she knows how to hurt Alex and Kara. Meanwhile, at an undisclosed location, Kara, Cat, and Maxwell are setting up a counter signal to Myriad which would broadcast an old analog signal from a defunct TV station Cat owns until Alex shows up. When she sees that she now wearing Kryptonite armor, Kara realizes, to her horror, that she is now mind controlled by Non. She challenges Kara to fight her to the death and Alex lunges at her.</div>

      <h1 style="color:white">Supergirl: Season 1: Episode 20: "Better Angels"</h1>
      <div class="box">Supergirl and a Myriad-controlled Alex Danvers charge each other in the air, with Alex cutting Kara with her Kryptonite blade. As the fight progressed, Alex gained the upper-hand, though before she could kill Kara, J'onn J'onzz carrying Eliza Danvers arrived. Eliza was successfully able to cease Myriad's control over Alex by reminding who she was - and that Jeremiah Danvers always said that Alex was the strongest of them all.

        At Cat Grant's first broadcasting station, Maxwell Lord and Cat explained to J'onn how their plan would work, with broadcasting Supergirl giving a speech about hope to cut Myriad's connection from the people of National City. As Supergirl gave her speech which was broadcast on every screen, citizens of National City awoke from their mind controlled states, including both Winn Schott and James Olsen.
        
        Elsewhere, Non recounted his failures to Indigo, who instead of looking at it as a failure, comforted him and suggested that they kill the humans of Earth and leave Supergirl behind as the hero of a dead world. The next day at CatCo Worldwide Media, James and Winn both apologized to Kara for their actions while under the control of Myriad, and for saving them. That reminded Kara of her failure to save Kelly, causing James to reassure her that no one would have been able to save all three of them, not even Superman. James and Kara then attempted to talk about their kiss, though they were interrupted by Cat Grant, who summoned them for the morning meeting.
        
        At the D.E.O. headquarters, Lucy Lane watched the cleanup effort of the headquarters. She then went to check on both J'onn J'onzz and Superman, who were both being tended. General Sam Lane then arrived, embracing Lucy, and then ordering that J'onn be re-secured as he was still a prisoner. Though Lucy tried to protest as J'onn was wounded and had just helped saved the entire city, but General Lane expressed that he was trying to protect them, however Lucy explained that he was doing the opposite. Lucy then went to apologize to J'onn, though J'onn told her he understood as he knew General Lane was just doing what he thought was right.
        
        In Alex Danvers' lab, both Alex and Kara cleaned it up, with Eliza coming in to find out why Alex and J'onn had really come to see her in Midvale. Alex explained to her mother that Jeremiah was actually alive, and that J'onn and herself were going to find him once Non and Indigo were captured. Maxwell Lord then came in to inform them that the Kryptonians were now using Myriad to try and kill them, since they weren't able to use it to control them. In the D.E.O. control center, he explained that they were increasing the Myriad frequency until every human's cranium exploded.
        
        Both Alex and Lucy were then called away to the armory by Agent Vasquez. Before Supergirl could leave, Maxwell Lord warned Supergirl that this was in fact a suicide mission as she had no backup. However Supergirl emphasized that she would stop Non and Indigo, though she asked Maxwell not tell Alex her odds of surviving. Later at CatCo, Winn noticed Kara's look of distraught, and asked her if she wanted in on the lunch order. Though she told him that she already had ate, Kara changed the subject, thanking Winn for always being a good friend to her before being called away by Cat. Grant demanded Kara get her a Moon Juice smoothie, though before she left she thanked Cat for being an amazing mentor and friend.
        
        In James' office, Kara told him that though she knew they could've been happy together, they missed their chance, and now the most important thing to her was that he find happiness. Though James attempted to find out why she would say such a thing, Kara quickly left. At the D.E.O., Kara went to see J'onn, remarking that she hated seeing him shackled. J'onn then informed Kara that James had called Lucy to inform her that Kara was acting strange, as if she was saying goodbye. Kara then told J'onn her odds, and that she was just saying the things she didn't get to say before Krypton was destroyed. In the D.E.O.'s control center, Maxwell Lord announced that he had found out what was powering Myriad, with Kara informing everyone that it was an Omegahedron, devices that they had used as energy sources on Krypton. Maxwell then told everyone that the Kryptonians were hiding in Nevada, leading General Lane to reveal that, that's where Fort Rozz had landed, and due to the spacecraft weighing a one-million ton, they had left it there. Though they concealed it with its own stealth technology, and cordoned off the area as a nuclear test zone.
        
        Kara then announced that she'd find them and shut it down, with J'onn arriving telling her that he'd join her. Though there were initial protests from General Lane, J'onn persuaded them to let him go, with Lucy giving the order for them to do so, and General Lane eventually agreeing. Before she left, Kara gave Alex the necklace her mother had given her, to keep it safe. Supergirl and J'onn arrived at Fort Rozz with Non and Indigo meeting them. The two villains announced their plan, and both sides engaged each other in battle, with Supergirl and Non fighting each other, and Indigo and J'onn battling one another. Around the world, citizens held their heads in pain as the Myriad signal increased. Back in Nevada, J'onn defeated Indigo by ripping her in half, while Supergirl and Non faced off in a heat vision battle, with Kara coming out victorious.
        
        However, a dying Indigo revealed that she had locked Fort Rozz's system, so they couldn't fly away the ship, which was powering Myriad. Inside Fort Rozz, Kara told Alex over her intercom that she was going to fly Fort Rozz into space herself, telling her sister goodbye in the process. After successfully taking Fort Rozz out of Earth's atmosphere, Supergirl went unconscious. Though she was saved by Alex Danvers, who used Kara's pod to rescue her. Back at the D.E.O., Alex gave Kara her necklace back and explained what had happened. In the control center, everyone applauded Supergirl as she came out. General Lane soon arrived and told J'onn that the President had pardoned him, and reinstated him as Director of the D.E.O.. Elsewhere, Maxwell Lord gave General Lane the Omegahedron.
        
        The next day at CatCo, Kara received a message from Clark, who told Kara how proud he was of her. Cat Grant then came to Kara's desk, putting her items into a box, and though Kara thought she was getting fired, Cat led her to her new office and told her she was getting a promotion. When she asked what Cat wanted her to do, Cat told her to think about what she might have to offer first, and then they will discuss her new job together. She also properly called Kara by her name for the first time. Later at her apartment, Kara, Alex, J'onn, Winn, and James had prepared a celebratory dinner together. James called Kara away for a minute to present her with a present - a picture of herself that he had taken. The two then kissed, and Kara was called to do her trick with the champagne bottle. The entire group then toasted to family. While doing so, a pod flying in the sky caught their attention, causing Kara and J'onn to leave to check it out. At the crash site, Kara recognized the pod as identical to hers, as it was from Krypton. She then went to open it and was surprised at what she found inside.</div>
