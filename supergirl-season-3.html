        <h1>Supergirl: Season 3: Episode 1: "Girl of Steel"</h1>
        <div class="box">In her mind, Kara walks through a field, eventually meeting Mon-El and Alura, whom she embraces. In reality, she is hovering over National City as Supergirl. She hears police sirens; three police cars are pursuing a stolen armoured truck. Two of them are stopped by the robbers' fire and the one containing Alex and Maggie is left trapped alongside the truck as one of the robbers, Robert DuBois, prepares to fire a machine gun at them. Supergirl blocks the bullets, then has a short fight with DuBois and tosses him aside, allowing him to slope off. Supergirl stops the truck as it was about to collide with a stationary car containing a family, but flies off without acknowledging anyone.

          Supergirl and Alex join J'onn and Winn at the D.E.O. where Supergirl berates herself for letting one of the robbers escape, even though the others credit her for saving lives and preventing the theft of aluminium rods. Supergirl gets Winn to take a sample of DuBois' blood from her hand to try and identify him. Alex tries to get her to meet them at the bar tonight and join her and Maggie in a tasting for their wedding but she won't commit. The others worry about how closed off she is.
          
          Morgan Edge is holding a meeting in his office where he talks about the city being rebuilt after the Daxamite invasion. James and Lena give credit to Supergirl. The mayor is planning to unveil a "Girl of Steel" statue on the waterfront but Edge wants the area re-zoned for a development. Both James and Lena oppose the plan, which will force people from their homes.
          
          Kara and James view Cat Grant making a typically acerbic answer in her role as President Olivia Marsdin's press secretary. Snapper Carr has gone on sabbatical. James leads a staff meeting but Kara is evasive about sending in an article on the invasion, although she insists she'll get it done. They then see Edge announcing on the news that he is buying CatCo. Kara goes to see Lena and asks her to talk to Edge: He has been secretly buying up shares and has now approached the major shareholders. Lena tries to talk to her about Mon-El but Kara refuses to be engage and sees a report of a burglary.
          
          At the bar, J'onn, Alex, Maggie, James, and Winn see the report of Supergirl stopping the burglary and conclude she's not coming. Maggie also notices Alex's lack of interest in the tasting and the wedding in general. A call from the DEO summons Supergirl, Winn, J'onn and Alex: They have identified DuBois, AKA Bloodsport, who disappeared after bombing city hall. He is ex-military and while trying to access the records from his old posting, Fort Douglas, Winn discovers there server is offline.
          
          Supergirl flies there and finds the guard overpowered. She investigates a lead-lined hangar where a laser beam from an unseen source fires at her and at a group of military personnel who investigate. She fires her heat vision at the source, revealing a cloaked Daxamite ship. DuBois flees while she is helping an injured soldier. James uses the signal watch to summon Kara to the office but she is furious to find it is simply because she missed her deadline. Uninterested in her life as Kara, she resigns from CatCo.
          
          J'onn has a heated phone conversation with General Lane about him holding alien technology without telling the DEO. Winn has found that DuBois stole a pressure regulator from the armoured truck and a cloaking device from the Daxamite ship. Put together, he can cloak an aircraft. Alex gets a call from James around Kara and goes to see her. Kara feels she is a success as Supergirl while as Kara Danvers she is a sad girl who gave up her boyfriend. She feels trying to be human was a mistake. Alex gives her the information on DuBois before adding that she likes Kara Danvers.
          
          Lena goes to see Edge and offers to invest in his company if he gives up the CatCo plan. However, Edge is looking forward to being able to use it to promote his own agenda. After Lena has gone, DuBois enters and reports that everything is ready.
          
          At the waterfront, Supergirl and J'onn watch the crowd gathering from the rooftop. Supergirl asks him about missing his family, saying she dreams of her mother and Mon-El. Maggie and Alex are in the crowd below. Alex assures Maggie she does want to be married to her but confesses she doesn't want a big wedding because her father won't be there to give her away. Maggie says she can choose her family. A girl, Ruby Arias, bumps into Alex and her mother, Samantha, gets her to come back and apologize.
          
          Lena unveils the statue but the waterfront is rocked by an explosion. Evidence points to a missile but Winn, back at the DEO, is unable to track it, even though it can't have been cloaked. Supergirl realizes the cloaking device has been used on a submarine, which is firing at the land under the waterfront. Tracking it with super-hearing, she dives into the water and disables the cloak. DuBois has a missile fired and then detonated, knocking out Supergirl and causing further waterfront damage. Ruby is trapped under a girder and Samantha, seemingly to her own surprise, exhibits super-strength in lifting it off her. Supergirl floats in the water but wakes when she sees Mon-El urging her to wake up. She stops the submarine firing again and flies it out of the water.
          
          Kara goes to see Lena, who has stopped Edge buying CatCo by buying it herself. She asks Kara to come back and help her run it. Edge arrives to remonstrate with her. Kara leaves and returns as Supergirl. She flies Edge out to a shipping trawler and reveals she knows he was behind the waterfront attack: She can't prove it but he has her attention. She flies off, leaving him stranded, but doesn't notice an alien ship lodged in the waterfront, uncovered by the explosions.
          
          Alex tells J'onn that she and Maggie are having a big wedding and she wants him to give her away, which he happily agrees to. Kara looks through keepsakes of Mon-El and texts Lena, agreeing to meet her at work for CatCo. She then joins Alex, James, J'onn, Winn, and Maggie at the bar.
          
          In a dream, a figure who looks like Alura is standing in a field. She suddenly turns around to reveal a distorted, snarling face. Samantha wakes up, horrified.</div>

                Later in the day, James and Winn approach Kara at CatCo and get some information about the leaflet. Kara uncovers the pamphlet has the Krypton image for Rao on the spread and they have to examine it further.
                
                The gathering chooses to go to the get-together to perceive what it's everything about. At the point when they arrive, they're promptly drawn closer by a more youthful part who guides them to their seats. The more established noble man we saw on the plane toward the start of the scene steps the platform and he uncovers the religion's name is "Offspring of Rao."
                
                He starts his lesson, expressing that they've all assembled on the grounds that Supergirl spared them.
                
                The congregation chief proceeds with his message and picks Olivia â€” the young lady the gathering drew closer at the asking of the administration â€” out of the group. Olivia approaches the platform and discloses to her story â€” in an intoxicated trance, Olivia nearly tumbled to her demise in the wake of tumbling off a rooftop however she was spared by Supergirl.
                
                The gathering closes the administration by imploring Supergirl.
                
                Back at the DEO, Winn's running record verifications on the congregation head â€” a man by the name of Thomas Coville â€” and they discover that the congregation is comprised of everybody spared by Supergirl.
                
                Kara tells the gathering that Coville knows an abundant excess about Rao and Krytpon folklore and requests them to burrow further.
                
                Kara, Lena, Samantha, Alex, and Maggie are having their young ladies late evening commending the merger as they circumvent sharing stories. Kara is summoned in light of the fact that a structure's ablaze and when she arrives, she finds a mama that necessities sparing.
                
                When he's sheltered on the ground, he's drawn closer by Olivia praising on turning into an individual from the congregation since he's been spared by Supergirl.
                
                Maggie appears at the scene and Kara reveals to her that the child deliberately set the fire so that Supergirl would spare him and he could join Coville's congregation.
                
                Ruby's at Samantha's office when another CatCo worker busts in. There's been an issue with the merger â€” Morgan Edge has recorded an enemy of trust grumbling.
                
                Kara approaches Coville at the congregation to pose a couple of inquiries about the religion he lectures his devotees. After a couple of more inquiries â€” Coville halts abruptly. He perceives Kara as Supergirl. Kara removes her glasses and requests Coville to quit having the gatherings and church social affairs.
                
                After Kara leaves, Coville goes to the rear of his congregation where a bigger Krypton antiquity is being kept and with his arms outstretched, he says resoundingly that he will "spare her."
                
                Ruby has nodded off on the love seat in her mom's office, sitting tight for her to complete work. Lena strolls in and Samantha advises her that she's gotten the protest excused. Samantha then separates to Lena â€” she said she has an inclination that she's the most exceedingly awful mother since she believes she hasn't given Ruby enough of her time.
                
                Kara's out on the overhang agonizing over National City when James moves toward her. The two discussion about Coville's confused lessons. Kara concedes that she doesn't have the foggiest idea how to stop Coville â€” she can't stop somebody's convictions.
                
                Kara heads to the DEO and teaches Winn to run following on the Betahedron â€” the curio we saw Coville addressing before. He's taken it to a neighborhood field during a hockey game. He's anticipating detonating it so Supergirl comes to spare the people in question so they can select them all to their congregation.
                
                Kara flies to the field trying to stop Coville while Alex speeds there on her bicycle. Kara approaches Coville about his activities and Coville discloses to her that he anticipates setting the Betahedron off in endeavor to change over each of the 15,000 individuals in the arena to their religion.
                
                Kara approaches the Betahedron and she falls â€” there's Kryptonite in it. Coville holds lecturing his supporters that Supergirl will spare them, yet Kara slices her hand to give them all she drains.
                
                Seeing her blood, Coville has a go at stopping the Betahedron and presses an inappropriate fastens and actuates it. Alex runs in and removes the Kryptonite from the Betahedron, however it's past the point of no return â€” it's going to detonate. With no an ideal opportunity to flie the touchy out of the arena, Kara utilizes her warmth vision to puncture the floor and Alex, with the assistance of Coville, drive the Betahedron into the holding, staying away from an immense debacle.
                
                Coville is seen detained and Kara has dropped by. She ensures they're rewarding him well. She asks whether he's going to tell anybody her character and he reveals to her he has overlooked the human name she let him know.
                
                Coville clarifies that he currently knows Rao's motivation for him, to help Supergirl be less occupied.

That evening, Eliza talks with Kara about how she hasn't really recovered from losing Mon-El. Kara claims different, but can't deny Eliza is right. Kara states she's coming to accept that she's not a human as Eliza tries to warn Kara against bottling her emotions. In the girls' old bedroom, Alex is drinking when Kara brings her coffee. She tries to help Alex by getting her to talk about losing Maggie, but Alex retorts that Kara didn't open up for months after Mon-El left and asks if she's really better. Angered, Kara tells Alex that she's not going to help her anymore and Alex thanks her for that, equally upset. Both sisters go to sleep.</div>
                  <h3 style="color:white">10 Years Ago</h3>
                  <div class="box">The episode flashes back to when Kara and Alex weren't close in high school. Both sisters resented each other, despite Eliza's best efforts. Kara makes fun how Alex has to work hard in math and science while she learned calculus on Krypton at the age of four. In a similar manner, Kara struggles with Earth's history while Alex is good at it. Kara isn't fond of going to an Earth school, feeling it's not for her. During history class, their teacher Mr. Bernard asks Kara who was the leader of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, which she answers wrong and Alex corrects her. But in gym class, with her powers, Kara easily beats Alex in rope climbing.

                    During lunch, Kara is made fun of by some students over her gushing of Superman until Alex shuts them down, though refuses Kara's gratitude. Alex sits with her friends, who are part of the popular clique and also dismiss Kara. Kara sits alone until she sees Kenny Li, who is her only real friend since they share similar interests and are both considered outcasts. Kenny briefly approaches and greets Alex, but she doesn't talk to him, since her clique disregards him, and says that he is only Kara's friend. School bully and star football player Jake Howell knocks down Kenny's tray onto the floor and starts shoving him. Kara gets angry and crushes the table, but controls herself before more damage is done. Alex and one of her friends, Vicki, intervene and tell Jake to lay off. Kenny quietly picks up his lunch and sits down with Kara. Kara complains about Alex always picking on her, but Kenny assures her that things will get better. Kenny also reveals he knows dirt on Jake, and invites Kara to join him at the local clearing in the evening.
                    
                    That night, Kara arrives at the woods, where Kenny stargazes with a telescope that can digitally capture and save pictures into his laptop. When wondering about distant stars, they nearly kiss until Kara pulls away. She tells Kenny he is the only person who makes her feel like she really belongs.
                    
                    When Kara sneaks back into her room, Alex confronts her and asks where she was. Kara refuses to answer, and Alex claims she has had enough of getting into trouble because of Kara's antics. Kara lashes out at Alex over always blaming her for every bad thing that has happened to her. Alex then pours out how much her life was upended ever since Kara was adopted, primarily the loss of her father Jeremiah, while Kara defends that none of those things are her fault.
                    
                    The next morning when Kara and Alex get off the school bus, Kara hears police sirens and with her super-hearing, learns the body of a male teenager has been found in the woods. Scared that it's Kenny, she rushes there using her powers. Kara's fear is proven to be true when she sees Kenny's corpse being examined by the police.
                    
                    As the news of Kenny's death becomes public, Kara mourns at his locker, where a memorial is put up. As she hears other students talking about his death, Kara can't understand why Kenny is remembered now like this, as no one really knew him. Alex approaches with her best friend Josie, trying to comfort her, but Kara claims Alex is just as bad as the rest. As Jake and his friends make fun of Kenny's death, Kara, certain he is the killer because Kenny had dirt on him, follows Jake to the locker room and starts accusing him. Jake isn't concerned, but with a little use of her super-strength, Kara twists his arm, and Jake confesses Kenny saw him smoking pot. Jake also reveals he was at home last night, and his mother can prove it. Kara leaves Jake alone and is determined to find out who killed Kenny.
                    
                    After school, Kara goes to Kenny's parents' house, where the sheriff, Ronald Collins, is questioning them. She offers her condolences to Kenny's parents. Mrs. Li reveals Kenny's telescope is missing and Kara swears she will find it. Sheriff Collins pulls Kara aside and tells her to leave this alone.
                    
                    That evening, Kara goes to the same clearing she and Kenny went to the previous night. She is startled by Alex, nearly burning the latter with her heat vision by accident. Kara wonders why Alex is here and vice versa. Alex reveals that she was failing calculus and Kenny offered to tutor her, but she wanted to keep it a secret so they would meet here. During that time, Alex became friends with him. Kara admits she was stargazing here with Kenny last night, and came when she heard that his telescope is missing. This was the last place it could have been, but it's not there now. As the telescope could save pictures to Kenny's laptop, both sisters realize that he must have seen something with it that led to his murder. Alex encourages Kara to use her X-ray vision to locate Kenny's laptop and she finds it buried under the leaves. Kara suggests they take it to the sheriff, but Alex believes they need more information first. They take the laptop home and find encrypted files on it, which Kara sends to her cousin Clark's friend Chloe, who is a capable hacker. They then check Kenny's email and find a warning message addressed to Mr. Bernard, containing an attachment of a picture in which Josie is making out with him, much to their shock.
                    
                    Concluding that Mr. Bernard murdered Kenny, Alex approaches Josie the next day at school and shows her the picture. Josie rips it up, but Alex has another. Josie is upset that her best friend would accuse Mr. Bernard of Kenny's death, claiming he is innocent. Josie insists she and Mr. Bernard are in love, to which Alex points out that their relationship is illegal since Mr. Bernard is sleeping with a minor, and thus committing statutory rape. As Josie angrily storms off, Alex calls the police. Meanwhile, Josie goes to Mr. Bernard and warns him that Alex knows about them.
                    
                    The following evening, Kara and Alex are walking home together for the first time ever, while discussing Josie and Mr. Bernard. As they are walking across a road bridge, a speeding car approaches and attempts to run them over. Kara pulls Alex over the bridge and they both drop down. The car leaves, and Kara uses her flight to prevent them from hitting the ground. Sheriff Collins later arrives at the scene and the girls claim the driver was Mr. Bernard. Eliza then comes to take the girls home.
                    
                    Arriving home, Eliza tells Alex to go to her room and orders Kara not to use her powers. Kara protests, but Eliza introduces her to a visiting FBI agent, Noel Neill, who looks exactly like Kara's biological mother, Alura Zor-El. Kara hugs her, but Noel clears the matter and explains the FBI are aware of her and her cousin. Noel warns Kara that every time she uses her powers, it puts Alex and Eliza in danger. Kara argues what good it is to have powers if she can't use them to help people, the only thing she ever wanted to do. Kara then tearfully admits she hates Earth, misses her birth family and planet, and wants to fight alongside her cousin. However, Noel points out that Kara is still a child and convinces her to be a human for her family's sake. Kara says, "I love you, Mom" in Kryptonese, which leaves Noel initially surprised, but she claims she can't understand it. As Noel leaves, it is revealed she was actually J'onn J'onzz in disguise.
                    
                    Later, Josie comes to the house, angry at Alex because her actions resulted in Mr. Bernard's arrest. Josie's parents have also grounded her until college, and she tried to defend Mr. Bernard to no avail. Josie then reveals she was with Mr. Bernard all afternoon before he was arrested, wanting to talk with him about Kenny's death. After getting Josie to reconfirm Mr. Bernard's alibi, Alex realizes that there's no way he is the driver who tried to ram her and Kara. She goes to Kara, who is feeling sullen after being talked out of using her powers, and tells her what she learned from Josie, but Kara is no longer interested. Alex then decides to find Kenny's killer by herself.
                    
                    Alex goes to the school stadium to talk with Sheriff Collins and tells him about the laptop. He wants to know where the laptop is, suggests they talk elsewhere, and takes Alex to a quiet room. At the same time, Kara gets an email from Chloe, who decrypted Kenny's files. She goes through them and sees pictures containing Sheriff Collins dealing with drugs, timestamped on the night Kenny died. Kara realizes that Collins must have somehow found out that Kenny had seen him in the act, so he killed him to cover his tracks, but not before Kenny managed to hide his laptop. Kara quickly calls Alex, who is talking with Collins, and tells her about the pictures and Collins. Alex realizes she is in danger but after she hangs up, Collins points his gun at her and takes away her phone. When Collins calls Kara to get information about the laptop, Alex shouts to Kara where she and Collins are. Collins cuts the call and takes Alex into the the boiler room.
                    
                    Kara concludes that Alex needs her help and decides to again use her powers, flying out to help her sister. Meanwhile, Collins is impressed with Alex's fortitude, as she hasn't flinched even though she has a gun in her face. Collins then reveals how drugs come across the Canadian border and he can make a nice profit selling them himself instead of burning them. Alex calls Collins out over killing a kid just to keep his crimes secret. Collins is convinced that no one can hear her from down there, but Alex, not shaking at all, tells him there is someone listening to his every word right now, and that wherever he goes, someone hears him. Boasting that she is coming, Alex then shouts, "Here! I'm down here!", and Kara punches her way through wall, knocking Collins out. The sisters embrace as Alex happily exclaims she knew Kara would come.
                    
                    Later at school over lunch, Alex tries to talk with Josie, but she rejects her. Realizing she has lost her friends, Alex sits with Kara instead. It was a good week for the sisters, as they exposed Jake's pot smoking, revealed Mr. Bernard as a child predator, and solved a murder. It has also made them outcasts in school, but Alex and Kara aren't concerned. Both wish Kenny was there now. Kara shows Alex a picture Kenny took that Chloe found, which captures her flying, meaning that he knew she is an alien but kept her secret. Kara reveals to Alex that she nearly kissed Kenny the night he died but panicked, admitting she would kiss him now in front of everyone if he were still here alive, as he truly liked Kara for who she is. Alex asks Kara if she wants hang out, as no one else wants to with her anymore. Alex suggests they go flying, but Kara refuses, having come to terms with keeping her powers hidden. Kara declares she'd rather be a human than lose Alex. Alex finally accepts Kara as her family, promising to work on being a better sister.
                    
                    In the evening, the sisters are in their bedroom together laughing when Eliza comes in with Kenny's telescope. She tells them it was found inside Collins' car, and that Mrs. Li wanted Kara and Alex to keep it as a gift of thanks. The Danvers sisters became close from that day forward.</div>
                    <h3 style="color:white">Back to the Present</h3>
                    <div class="box">Alex wakes up mildly hungover and gets coffee. She finds Kara on the terrace looking through Kenny's telescope. Both sisters reminisce about Kenny and how he was Kara's first true loss on Earth, a good friend of Alex, and a "keeper of secrets". Alex admits that experience was the first time she and Kara really became sisters, making her see that together, they can do anything. Kara reflects that she never thought she could feel at home on Earth, and in a way she still doesn't, but feels at home with Alex. Even though Kara lost Mon-El and Alex lost Maggie, they still have each other.

                      When the sisters leave to return to National City, they bid Eliza goodbye. J'onn has asked them to come straight back to DEO, and also warns he's going to put them into containment if they scratch his car. Eliza packs her daughters food and sends them off with some final advice. Alex demands that she drive, pointing out that Kara nearly crashed the car twice on the way to Midvale. Kara argues that it was not her fault that an opossum she nearly hit came out of nowhere but at Alex's insistence, reluctantly hands over the keys. As Alex begins driving home to National City, the sisters begin singing to the radio, now in higher spirits.</div>

                      <h1>Supergirl: Season 3: Episode 7: "Wake Up"</h1>
                      <div class="box">"Wake Up" starts a couple of individuals in an submarine-type machine. They're close to the National City waterfront examining the smashed spaceship we saw earlier in the season. As they approach it, a light emission impacts them.

                        Samantha is preparing supper for Ruby when she gets a thought â€” she looks down at the pot of boilng water. Sooner rather than later, she lowers her hand into the water and doesn't find her hand burning. She arranges for Ruby to go eat at her friend's house.
                        
                        At the DEO, Kara teaches Winn to investigate the boat at the waterfront. He says it's been there for 12,000 years and it was made with metal that is not on the periodic table. Kara, Winn, and J'onn go examine the boat and J'onn phases the gathering inside the boat.
                        
                        They glance around inside the boat and are shot at. At the point when the aggressor ventures into the light, we see that it's Mon-El â€” he and Kara gasp.
                        
                        The gathering takes Mon-El back to the DEO to run indicative tests and discover that he's ready to inhale Earth's air now. Addressing him, Mon-El uncovers the others in the chambers on the boat are "like him," travelers on the boat.
                        
                        The room clears and Mon-El and Kara have a speedy talk. Mon-El discloses to her he's been attempting to make an impression on her for seven months.
                        
                        Samantha drives to a house where a lady named Patricia opens the entryway. After a discussion, we discover Patricia is Samantha's adoptive mother â€” she kicked Samantha out of the house when she got pregnant with Ruby. Samantha questions her mom if she showed indications of super powers when she was growing up. Samantha asks Patricia for more information about her birth mother and discloses to Patricia how she got shot however wasn't injured.
                        
                        Patricia takes Samantha to a horse shelter on the habitation and shows her the pod she used to venture out to Earth in. Patricia uncovers she didn't adopt Samantha, she found her in the pod. While inspecting the ship, it activates once Samantha touches it.
                        
                        James shows up to the DEO to converse with Kara about Mon-El's return. She admits to James that Mon-El's been really far off since he's returned.
                        
                        Samantha is gathering her sacks to go on a trip without anyone else. She discloses to Ruby that she needs to do it without anyone else and reveals to her she'll forget about cash for take since the sitter's cooking is abominable.
                        
                        Alex advises J'onn to go be with his father and show him the sights around National City, her and Winn will keep observing the submerged boat circumstance. Subsequent to getting espresso, J'onn and M'yrnn get into a contention and M'yrnn strolls off.
                        
                        Back at the DEO, a careful Mon-El studies his environmental factors before unfastening himself from the hardware to sneak about. He's ready to discover a type of weapons room, and stifles out a DEO operator before being thumped oblivious himself by Kara.
                        
                        Mon-El rises and shines and Kara's put him in on of the DEO holding cells. She ask what he was up to however can't get any data out of him.
                        
                        Samantha's out and about going through a desert, she takes an earth street and stops to discover her vehicle is overheating.
                        
                        It's Winn's chance to converse with Mon-El. Winn approaches him about the outsider boat and Mon-El consoles him there's a great deal of stuff he wouldn't comprehend. Mon-El requests Winn's assistance to return to the boat, revealing to him individuals â€” Kara included â€” will get injured in the event that he isn't reclaimed to the boat.
                        
                        Kara strolls in to the holding chamber to see Mon-El is never again is his cell.
                        
                        Wnn and Mon-El are back on the boat, utilizing the thing Mon-El recuperated in the safe room at the DEO. They pivot Kara to discover Kara on their boat. Kara and Mon-El get into a battle, when Mon-El uncovers he's been away for a long time. At the point when he propelled into space toward the finish of last season, he was sucked through a wormhole and lived in the 31st century for a long time before having the option to return.
                        
                        The cases on the boat start flopping advertisement one of Mon-El's partners starts suffocating in the case. Kara's ready to step in, break the glass, and salvage the lady in the unit. Mon-El calls her Imra.
                        
                        With her vehicle stalled, Samantha's strolling through the desert with expectations of discover help when the ground begins shaken and shakes begin jutting starting from the earliest stage. At the point when complete, the stones structure a post.
                        
                        Mon-El, Winn, and Kara take Imra back to the DEO to screen her vitals.
                        
                        J'onn takes M'yrnn to his loft and discusses his time on Earth. J'onn requests that his dad move into the condo with him, saying they could make it their new home.
                        
                        Mon-El is agonizing over National City on an overhang when Kara approaches him. Before she's ready to state anything, Mon-El apologizes. They two are talking and Mon-El is going to reveal to Kara something when Imra awakens. Mon-El races to her and they kiss, a lot to the astonishment of Kara. Mon-El discloses to Kara that Imra is his better half.
                        
                        Samantha enters the post and uses the precious stone she took from her case to put into an entire inside the stronghold. When she does as such, a multi dimensional image opens up and clarifies that Samantha is Kryptonian. The 3D image clarifies that Samantha's motivation is to be an "agent of Justice" and calls her a world-executioner. Samantha is cautioned that she'll before long disregard her little girl Ruby and reveal to her it's the ideal opportunity for her to become Reign. Samantha pairs over in torment and when she returns to her feet, her eyes glow red and she says, "I have awoken" in Kryptonese.</div>

                        <h1>Arrowverse Crossover: Crisis On Earth-X: Supergirl: Season 3: Episode 8: Part 1</h1>
                        <div class="box">In a Nazi-ruled universe, Earth-X, a resistance group comes under attack by Dark Arrow. He wipes out all resistance members, and also kills the Earth-X version of the Guardian, but not before he says someone will end the Nazi regime. Dark Arrow finds a device on the resistance hideout.

                          On Earth-1, heroes of Team Flash, Team Arrow and Legends contemplate about going to Barry and Iris' wedding, and they all agree to go. On Earth-38, Kara is fighting a Dominator and defeats it. Afterwards, she and Alex are brooding over their lives in Kara's apartment, until Alex sees the invitation to Barry's wedding. Initially both sisters aren't keen on going, but Kara decides they will, and takes her interdimensional extrapolator and opens a portal to Earth-1.
                          
                          In a manicure shop at Central City, Iris, Caitlin, Felicity and Kara are having their nails done and discuss about Iris' wedding and others also suggest that Felicity would marry Oliver next (and the manicurist breaks her nail-maker on Kara's fingers). In a dress-shop, Barry and Oliver are proving their suits, and Oliver is happy Barry is taking the step, and he also wishes the same for him. In S.T.A.R. Labs, Wells and Cisco have managed to create a formula that can separate the Firestorm Matrix from Stein and Jax. While Stein is thrilled, Jax is not enthusiastic, as it would mean he won't have any powers.
                          
                          On Earth-X, everyone greets the Dark Arrow as FÃ¼hrer and he asks if the Nazis can get the device working. A female Nazi, Overgirl, appears, flying like Supergirl, and tells that they have one day.
                          
                          Just before Barry and Iris' rehearsal dinner, Jax leaves S.T.A.R. Labs and Caitlin walks in to talk with Stein, who is working with something. Caitlin takes also some credit for the cure, that was made to break up Firestorm. At the rehearsal dinner at CC Jitters, everyone greets each other, and Alex makes a closer acquaintance with Sara Lance, and they start drinking Scotch heavily. They are witnessed by Barry and Kara, with Kara claiming no one can drink Alex under the table (not knowing that no one has outdrank Sara either). Barry asks what's going on with Kara, and she reveals what happened with Mon-El, and Barry can't give her any advice on that. Barry then asks Kara to sing at the reception, and she agrees. Stein comes, and he privately reveals to Jax he was working on a compound, that will give him new superpowers after the Firestorm has been broken, but Jax is not thrilled about the possible abilities (it will allow him to stick to things). Joe holds a speech for the couple and points out that because of them, he openly reveals his relationship with Cecile. They toast, and outside, Sara and Alex are making out. Afterwards, Oliver proposes to Felicity, but she says no, claiming that while she loves him, she doesn't want to marry him, yelling it for everyone to hear when he continues to push for it. Embarrassed, she leaves.
                          
                          The next morning, Barry leaves quietly, making Iris breakfast in bed for her to wake up to, and it is shown how everyone has slept (with Felicity wishing she could airsleep like Kara). Sara and Alex slept the night together, but when Alex realizes it, she is embarrassed and attempts to leave quietly. Everyone gather at the church, and Kara worryingly waits for Alex to show up, as she shouldn't be strolling on a different Earth. She eventually does, and claims she was okay, but can't bring herself to admit what happened last night. Sara arrives and, despite Alex trying to not bring it up, Kara eventually figures out that they slept together. Alex is embarrassed, describing what she did as "such a guy thing to do" but Kara assures her she did nothing wrong and describes Sara as awesome, though is less approving of her being an assassin, to which Alex adds she is a sassy assassin. Inside the church, Mick happens to sit right next to Captain Singh. While waiting for Iris, Barry meets with a caterer, who offers him drinks. She is excited about the wedding, declaring it will be "one for the ages". Barry wonders if they've met before, to which the girl quickly claims they haven't. Before leaving, the girl urges Barry to remember to say, "I do."

                          As the ceremony begins, Kara sings "Runnin' Home to You" as Joe walks Iris down the aisle. The official ceremony begins, but when the minister asks if anyone is against this marriage, he is vaporized by a heat vision blast. Nazis from Earth-X, led by Dark Arrow, Overgirl and Earth-X version of Prometheus enter the church (with Oliver, Barry and Kara unanimously saying "I hate Nazis!"), and a fight breaks out. With no other choice, the heroes are forced to fight with their powers to save everyone. Barry and Wally use their speed to catch bullets, assist in evacuating the guests and take down Nazi soldiers while Kara takes on Overgirl, who has the same abilities as her, both landing solid blows on each other. Jax and Stein merge as Firestorm and engage the Nazis. Sara and Alex take down a group of soldiers together before taking on Prometheus; Oliver unsheathes his portable bow and saves Wells from Dark Oliver's arrows. Cisco tells Caitlin to introduce Killer Frost on these Nazis, and she does (and Frost complains about Caitlin's dress), launching icicles at them before engaging them with an ice sword while Mick covers her with his heat gun. During the fight, Oliver tells Cisco to breach him to the Dark Arrow, but finds he is equally matched against him. Kara and Overgirl continue to struggle to get one over each other until the latter throws the former throws the side of the church with enough force to launch debris everywhere, knocking Cisco unconscious, who is only saved at the last second from Nazis by Barry's intervention. Overgirl floats back into the church thinking she has won and tells Kara to stay down, however Kara rushes back up and claps her hands together, producing a powerful thunderclap, knocking Overgirl to the floor along with disorienting everyone else. Before Overgirl can recover, Kara grabs her and punches her hard in the stomach across the room, stunning her enough to prevent her getting back up. Dark Arrow jumps to help her and the Nazis retreat. Meanwhile, Sara and Alex have defeated Prometheus and take him captive. Everyone gather at S.T.A.R. Labs and Prometheus is taken to the pipeline by Sara and Jax. Mick says everyone's memories about the attack are erased, so everyone's secret identities are safe. Stein and Caitlin examine Cisco. He has a concussion, but he'll be alright. Stein wonders why Caitlin is wearing her Killer Frost outfit, and she reveals that Killer Frost emerges, when she gets scared or angry, and she is certainly going to emerge before this is over. Barry asks Wally to protect Joe and Cecile. The heroes then wonder, who these people were. Stein claims it is unprecedented that they would really be from a Nazi regime, as it was destroyed over 70 years ago, and Oliver and Kara claim the enemies they took on were equal in power and skill to them. Prometheus is not in a talkative mood, but Oliver says they'll make him talk.

On a rooftop somewhere in Central City, Dark Arrow and Overgirl meet with Eobard Thawne/Reverse-Flash, wearing the face of Harrison Wells. He scolds the two for attacking recklessly and allowing Prometheus to be captured. Dark Arrow is revealed to be the Earth-X counterpart for Oliver, and he tells an opportunity came with the wedding. Eobard and Oliver nearly clash, but Overgirl breaks up the fight. Overgirl is revealed to be Kara's Earth-X counterpart, and she claims they will try again, and they will kill all the heroes of this Earth.</div>

<h1>Arrowverse Crossover: Crisis On Earth-X: Arrow: Season 6: Episode 8: Part 2</h1>
                          <div class="box">The Earth-X Prometheus is revealed to be Tommy Merlyn. Oliver has a private talk with him, while others try to determine, where does these Nazis come from. Sara, Jax and Stein come up with a theory of time traveling Nazis, which could mean they are anachronisms, but it doesn't make sense, since they crashed Barry and Iris' wedding. Barry then thinks they are from another Earth. Kara says that there are 52 Earths, but none of them has a Nazi regime. Wells then says that there is a 53rd Earth, which is called Earth-X. It doesn't have an official designation, because it is so horrible no sane person would ever travel there. He then shows that Earth-X history followed same events as Earth-1, but with a critical difference. Stein realizes that on Earth-X the Nazis developed the atomic bombs before Americans, and used them to annihilate their enemies, thus winning World War II. Hitler continued his brutal reign until he died in 1994. Oliver tries to get through Tommy, but when Tommy manages to fool Oliver into thinking he was forced into this by the FÃ¼hrer, he kills himself with cyanide capsule. Earth-X Oliver receives a signal that his best friend, Tommy, is dead. Thawne is upset about how their plan is not going as it should. Oliver slams Thawne to a pillar, forcing Earth-X Kara to step in, when Thawne threatens to rip Oliver's heart. Eventually they calm down, and Oliver orders Thawne to find the Prism. He leaves, and Kara encourages Oliver to trust in their plan, as he made it. They kiss, indicating they are married on Earth-X.

                            Felicity calls Curtis and has him run a search for dimensional vortices supported with S.T.A.R. Labs systems. Oliver comes, and he talks with Felicity, why she refused his proposal. Felicity explains that while she loves Oliver, she is afraid that history will repeat itself, as she got shot after their last engagement in "Dark Waters".
                            
                            Caitlin, Wells and Jax try to come up with a way to track the Nazis, but it's not going so well, since Cisco is out of commission. Stein comes and asks to speak with Jax alone. Jax finally reveals, why he is acting the way he does. Once they disconnect Firestorm and Martin leaves, Jax feels he no longer will have what he really wants: Stein, calling him the closest thing he has for a father. Alex comes back to the Labs, and meets Sara. She asks is Alex okay, and she claims she is. Sara goes on the lift and thinks there's not going to be a thing between the two. Alex believes so, too. Kara comes and wonders, why Alex is like this. Alex explains that she thinks she made a mistake by making a one night stand with a strange woman, thinking it goes against the awesome thing she had with Maggie. Kara reassures her, that what she had with Maggie was real and awesome, but through her, Alex learned she is a lesbian and to be true to herself.
                            
                            Iris rolls around in a chair and asks Felicity, how long is it going to take for the brainiacs to track down Earth-Xers. She doesn't know and tells Iris she is dealing with some Oliver stuff. Iris knows it's about Felicity refusing Oliver's proposal, as everyone heard her back at the rehearsal dinner. Felicity then gets a ping from a company building, which is under attack by Nazis. Iris goes to get Barry.
                            
                            Outside the attacked building, Kara flies to the spot and Barry speeds there. They have to wait a while, as Oliver comes with his motorcycle. He then remarks he doesn't have super speed like them. The three heroes then come face to face with their enemies, who have stolen the Prism. Dark Arrow, Overgirl and Reverse-Flash unmask themselves, and all three heroes are shocked, as Oliver and Kara are going up against their doppelgÃ¤ngers, and Barry once again comes face to face with his arch-enemy. Thawne explains he used time-travel to escape his fate after Eddie Thawne killed himself, but nothing beyond that. Oliver-X remarks, that for both him and Oliver this is like looking in a mirror and seeing only weakness. Kara-X says the same to Kara, and gloats, how on Earth-X they formed a meritocracy after Hitler's reign, and Kara declares her a pervert. Thawne speeds up and Barry takes on him. Oliver takes an arrow and aims at Kara-X. She remarks it won't hurt her, but Oliver says this arrow will and shoots her. And the arrow does hurt her, as Oliver shot her with a Kryptonite arrow, shocking Kara. Oliver says he made them in case an evil version of Kara shows up. Kara-X attacks Oliver, but Kara jumps in between and blows her away with her freezing breath. Oliver-X runs after Kara-X, and she is pissed. He suggest she take her anger at a nearby building under construction. She uses her heat vision to weaken the building structure. The villains escape as Oliver, Barry and Kara move to rescue the workers and stabilize the building. They succeed.
                            
                            Oliver, Barry and Kara return to S.T.A.R. Labs and Barry gives Alex the arrow Oliver used on Overgirl, and reveals that Dark Arrow and Overgirl are Oliver and Kara's Earth-X doppelgÃ¤ngers. Alex is shocked that there is another Kara, but Wells says there are actually 53 Karas, just like there are 53 Earths and 53 Kryptons. Alex goes to analyze the blood sample on the arrow, and quickly learns the blood has a massive amount of solar radiation within it, which could be a weakness in Overgirl. With this the team thinks they might be able to track her. Elsewhere, Thawne tells Kara-X that he is worried, that if the time comes, Oliver-X will choose his wife over the Fatherland. Kara-X claims Oliver will stay on the right path, but also assures that she will make sure he chooses the Fatherland over her.
                            
                            Caitlin, Felicity, Wells and Stein are trying to locate Overgirl. Mick approaches Caitlin and asks her how Killer Frost appears. She uneasily admits it happens, when she is scared or angry. Mick tries to scare her, but Caitlin just remarks "Nice try." Wells manages to locate Overgirl. In the Time Vault, Barry looks at Thawne's records and remarks how seeing his face always brings back the memory of his mother's death. Oliver comes and encourages Barry and Iris to maintain their love, and Barry says Felicity will come around with him, but stops, when she appears. Felicity tells they found them. Alex, White Canary, Firestorm, the Flash, Supergirl and Green Arrow arm and prepare themselves for battle.
                            
                            At the site, the heroes enter the Nazis location. Barry knocks all Nazis out, but soon they see they are surrounded. A fight starts and while Barry takes on Reverse-Flash and Kara takes on Overgirl, Alex says she can see enemy Flash and enemy Supergirl, which leaves everyone wondering, where is Oliver-X. Unknown to everyone, he's entering the S.T.A.R. Labs. In the Labs, the women are wondering, why Mick didn't go with the others. Wells encounters Dark Arrow, and manages to trigger the alarm, but Dark Arrow knocks him out. Mick tells Felicity and Iris to hide, while he and Killer Frost prepare to take on Dark Arrow. At the battle site, the heroes are fighting with everything they have, but Overgirl knocks Oliver down. He recovers and attempts to shoot her with Kryptonite arrow just as she is about to finish Sara off, but Overgirl catches the arrow. In S.T.A.R. Labs, Dark Arrow enters the Speed Lab, and is attacked by Mick. Dark Arrow easily disables him. He then remarks "I bet you're scared now!", but Dark Arrow claims he doesn't fear anything. Mick remarks he wasn't talking to him, and then Killer Frost grabs his bow and starts freezing it. She claims he didn't think this through, but he uses an electrical device to knock her out. Then, members of Team Arrow appear and take him on. However, he manages to beat them, and the Nazis also defeat the heroes at the battle site by unleashing a fully automated Metallo.
                            
                            As the heroes recover, they find they have been shackled and they have collars on their necks. Thawne claims he could kill them, but Alex says they already would have, otherwise they wouldn't have the collars. Oliver-X appears, and Kara-X collapses, feeling intense pain. Through Oliver-X's encouragement that they found her, she manages to stand up. Thawne then reveals to heroes that Kara-X is dying. Alex realizes it's because of the massive solar radiation in her body. Kara-X confirms it by saying she flew too close to the sun. And in order to save her, she needs a new heart, which Supergirl can provide. That's why they stole the Prism, to use it in order to expose both Karas to red sunlight in order to perform the surgery for the heart transfer. They took others prisoner to use them as bargaining chips. Alex is terrified and Oliver claims that he will kill Oliver-X, but he claims he won't, since he is weak. Metallo unleashes a Kryptonite beam and knocks the heroes out.
                            
                            In S.T.A.R. Labs, Felicity and Iris find the place is quiet, and wonder where everyone are. Felicity then wonders how can Iris maintain her life with aliens, Nazis and other villains constantly on them. She reveals that by waking next to Barry. Felicity then silences her, as they hear someone coming. It's a Nazi, and they back away. The women then witness the Nazis locking up Rene into the pipeline, and are worried, what has happened to everyone. Elsewhere, Oliver, Barry, Sara, Alex, Stein and Jax wake up somewhere, and Alex is terrified that Kara is gone. Sara assures her they'll get her back. People are being escorted somewhere, their hands bound. Jax claims this is not their Earth, and Sara claims they are on Earth-X, in a concentration camp.</div>

                          <div class="box">Barry, Oliver, Sara, Alex, Martin, and Jax wake up in a Nazi concentration camp on Earth-X, with handcuffs and power dampening collars. They wonder of all the "undesirables" the Nazis have rounded up. Jax asks from one of the captives, what was his crime, and he says he loved the wrong person.

                            On Earth-1, the Nazis have rounded up nearly everyone in the S.T.A.R. Labs pipeline (including Cisco, Caitlin, Wells, Wild Dog, Mr. Terrific and Black Canary). At the same time, Kara has been strapped into a surgery table with artificial red sunlight from the Prism siphoning her powers. Thawne is preparing for the surgery, but it takes a while for Kara's powers to reach the point it can be performed. Overgirl then has a private chat with her doppelgÃ¤nger, and mocks Kara for protecting the weak, while she has taken on the belief that it is the purpose of the weak to fuel the strong and how she revels in being regarded as a god. Kara sees that Overgirl's ideology is not leading, but ruling. Overgirl agrees with that and tells Kara that her heart is worthless. But Kara counters it by saying that at least she has a heart. In the ventilation shafts, Felicity and Iris hear everything and they have to figure out, how to save Kara and others before the surgery is performed.
                            
                            On Earth-X, the heroes are taken away by the leader of the concentration camp, who is revealed to be the Earth-X doppelgÃ¤nger of Quentin Lance, known only as SturmbannfÃ¼hrer. He talks with Sara, telling that he once had a daughter like her, and killed her due to her sexuality. They are taken away to be executed, alongside the prisoner, Ray Terrill, whom Jax talked with. Oliver attempts to strike at the Nazis, but their collars act as shock collars, and they are easily put down. As the execution takes place, the heroes are suddenly rescued by Earth-X doppelgÃ¤nger of Leonard Snart, Leo Snart aka Citizen Cold. In the chaos, the heroes manage to break free and escape with Leo and Ray to the Freedom Fighters hideout, an Earth-X version of Arrowcave in Star City.
                            
                            Back at Earth-1, Felicity and Iris attempt to free everyone from the pipeline, but before they succeed, they are just about to be spotted. Instead, Felicity sends a distress signal to the Legends.
                            
                            The Freedom Fighters are led by General Schott, Earth-X counterpart of Winn Schott. He reveals the only way back to Earth-1 is through a breach facility, and he doesn't allow Earth-1 heroes to pass through it, as destroying it presents an opportunity to trap Nazi leaders, Dark Arrow and Overgirl, to Earth-1, and give the Freedom Fighters a chance to liberate Earth-X. Alex tries to convince him to give them a little time for them to pass through, trying to convince him, that his counterpart on Earth-38 is one of Kara's best friends, and he would do anything for her. The general refuses. Later, Alex tries to find a gun, intending to go it alone to save her sister. Sara finds her and swears Alex that they will not let Kara die, and encourages her to trust her instincts and reveals how she always wants to return to her former lover, Nyssa, but hasn't. But she gives Alex her support in saving Kara, telling her that she is part of her team now. Eventually, Ray and Leo, who are lovers, manage to convince the General to give them the time they need to pass through the breach. The heroes put up a daring plan to infiltrate the facility, as Oliver can impersonate the FÃ¼hrer.
                            
                            On Earth-1, the surgery is about to begin and Overgirl is put into a hibernation, while Kara is being kept awake. As Thawne begins, the power goes out. Dark Arrow orders a sweep. Felicity and Iris have managed to use the Time Vault computer to turn off the power. As the Nazis sweep the Labs, the women sneak to the medical room and free Kara. They try to take her outside to recharge, but all exists are blocked, forcing them to hide.
                            
                            On Earth-X, Leo infiltrates the breach facility with Oliver and Oliver uses his appearance to trick the Nazis. He meets with the SturmbannfÃ¼hrer and Oliver witnesses as the Nazis send their secret weapon to Earth-1, the Wellenreiter, Earth-X version of the Waverider. Oliver had to let it go as to not blow his cover. Meanwhile, Sara, Alex, Stein and Jax sneak in to the facility, while Barry and Ray are ready to provide support. However, General Schott backs away on his promise and sends the Red Tornado to attack and destroy the facility, forcing Barry and Ray to take care of it before it reaches the facility. SturmbannfÃ¼hrer suspects Oliver is not the FÃ¼hrer, and puts him into a test: to kill a jew, who shared her rations with other prisoners in the camps. The jew is Felicity's Earth-X counterpart. Oliver tries to shoot the SturmbannfÃ¼hrer, but the gun is empty. With his cover blown, Oliver assaults the Nazis, and Alex and Sara engage the Nazis alongside Firestorm. Oliver defeats the nazis and gives a machine gun to Felicity's doppelgÃ¤nger, encouraging her to escape. Oliver joins others, and the Nazis send everyone they have to fight the heroes.
                            
                            On Earth-1, Thawne discovers what Felicity and Iris did, and they and Kara are eventually found. As Felicity encoded the sequence to restore power, Thawne tries to make her tell. Felicity holds strong, but Thawne threatens to kill Iris, unless she gives the code. Kara, unwilling to let any of her friends get hurt, surrenders and tells Felicity to reveal the code, on the condition Thawne and Dark Arrow spare the others. In tears, Felicity reveals the code, and Kara is taken back for the surgery.
                            
                            The fight on Earth-X keeps going. To activate the breach, two controllers must be used. Stein coerces Jax and him to separate, as he thinks they have a better chance to succeed like that. Jax manages to hotwire his end, but Stein gets pinned down by Nazi gunfire before he can reach the other device. Oliver, Sara, Alex and Leo take out many Nazis, but more come, while Barry and Ray attempt to deal with Red Tornado, eventually succeeding. Stein tries to run to the controller, but he is shot in the back by SturmbannfÃ¼hrer. The episode ends as Stein begins to bleed.</div>

                            <div class="box">Despite Stein getting shot, he gathers all his strength and manages to activate the device, opening the breach. Oliver, Barry, Sara, Alex, Leo and Ray defeat the remaining Nazis. In order for Stein to survive, he needs to get to the Waverider and have Gideon to treat him. Jax fuses with him to give him more time. The heroes return to Earth-1, and Ray and Leo join them.

                              In S.T.A.R. Labs, the surgery on Kara can finally begin. Due to pure sadism, Kara is still going to be kept awake during the procedure. As Thawne takes a scalpel and directs it towards Kara's heart, he suddenly stops. Dark Arrow wonders, why he isn't doing it. Thawne claims he is trying, but hasn't seen that Ray Palmer, shrunken with his Atom suit, is preventing him from cutting Kara. He enlarges, and knocks Thawne and Dark Arrow out. Kara is shockingly surprised, as she has never seen the full capabilities of Ray's suit. Ray releases Kara, while Nate frees the captives Cisco, Caitlin, Wild Dog, Mr. Terrific, Black Canary, Mick and Wells from the pipeline. Amaya and Zari take out the Nazis elsewhere. Oliver, Barry, Sara, Alex, Firestorm, Leo and the Ray also arrive and joins the fight. Ray, Felicity and Kara attempt to flee through the elevator, but it is guarded by Metallo. Felicity flees with Kara, and Metallo makes its way into the Speed Lab, where it is destroyed with the combined might of Vibe, Killer Frost, Black Canary, Atom, Wild Dog, Mr. Terrific, Firestorm, Heat Wave, Citizen Cold, Steel, Vixen and Zari. Barry saves Iris. Dark Arrow goes after Kara and traps her and Felicity in the breach lab. He swears he will kill her unless she hands Kara. Felicity refuses and stands her ground, revealing how her grandparents didn't survive the Holocaust, but she will not back down, she'd rather die than let him hurt Kara. Oliver arrives at the scene, holding Overgirl with a knife at her throat. He swears he will kill her if Dark Arrow hurts Felicity or Kara. He then tries to convince his doppelgÃ¤nger that S.T.A.R. Labs has some of the greatest minds on this Earth, and they can find a way to fix Overgirl's heart without the need to cut out Kara's heart. Overgirl urges her husband to kill Felicity, as she thinks Oliver is lying. As Dark Arrow is considering the possibility, Thawne speeds him and Overgirl away. Felicity and Oliver hug and kiss.
                              
                              The heroes gather in the Waverider, and Stein is taken to Gideon to be treated with Caitlin helping the A.I. Many reunions and meetings take place in the ship: Kara and Alex are joyfully reunited, Mick meets his old partners doppelgÃ¤nger, Sara and Oliver discuss the situation.
                              
                              Ray asks Caitlin, does Stein have any hope. Caitlin is not optimistic, as she and Gideon have tried everything. Jax goes to see Stein, and due their psionic link, Stein's injuries are also affecting Jax: if Stein dies so will Jax, as Jax is the only thing keeping Stein alive right now. Stein talks with Jax to let him go, as he has had a great life, but he is old now, and Jax still has a whole life ahead of him. Broken to tears, Jax tells Stein not to say things like that. Stein shows Jax the newly synthetic formula Gideon made, that can separate the Firestorm Matrix and tells Jax to give it to him. With an extremely heavy heart, after much convincing, Jax hands the formula to Stein and he drinks it. He thanks Jax for the adventure and dies immediately after. Jax cries openly over the death of his surrogate father. As Sara sees Jax crying, she goes to Stein to see him dead. Struck with the loss of her friend and comrade, Sara kisses his forehead. Stein's death affects everyone on the ship. Jax goes to Clarissa and Lily to tell them sad news.
                              
                              The heroes then decide to gather for a one last battle against the Nazis, for Stein. Gideon informs Oliver that the Wellenreiter is sending a message. Dark Arrow gives the heroes of Earth-1 a chance to save this Earth: he and the Nazis will leave back to Earth-X, but Supergirl will come with them. Oliver declares the difference between them: he won't abandon his friends and cuts the transmission. As the captain of the Waverider, Sara commands the heroes to fight.
                              
                              The Wellenreiter, commanded by Overgirl, starts bombarding innocents in Central City, while Dark Arrow leads the ground forces. As the Nazis cause mayhem, they are met by the heroes of Team Arrow, Team Flash, Legends, Supergirl, Alex, Citizen Cold and the Ray. An all out battle follows, in which Oliver takes on Dark Arrow, Barry takes on Thawne and the rest handle Nazis. Meanwhile, Cisco, Wells, Felicity and Iris fly the Waverider against the Wellenreiter. The only hope they have to destroy it, is to take out it's shields, but it's no use, as the ships are of equal power. Felicity says they need something more powerful to take it on. Kara is on the job, and flies after it. The Wellenreiter crew sees something aside Waverider following them. Overgirl commands to shoot it down, but they can't as it is too close. As Overgirl looks out from the window, she sees Kara, who openly challenges her. With great fury, Overgirl charges at Supergirl, starting the duel between the two Kryptonians. However, by charging at Supergirl, she unwittingly exposed the Wellenreiter. Felicity says someone has to get inside the ship to disable it's shields. Killer Frost, along with Vixen and Zari, uses her ice path to get inside the ship. The three women get inside, overpower the crew and manage to disable the shields. Cisco gives control of the Waverider to Wells while he breaches inside the Wellenreiter to rescue their friends. The Wellenreiter is destroyed, and the heroes gain an upper hand against the Nazis, with only Oliver and Dark Arrow still fighting an equal battle. Barry fights against Thawne across the city, and ultimately defeats him. Thawne goads Barry to kill him, but Barry refuses, and Thawne realizes yet again that Barry Allen is above killing. Barry tells Thawne to leave, and he does, abandoning his Earth-X allies, but also telling Barry they will meet again. Finally, Overgirl's excess solar radiation poisoning reaches its limit, and she starts to go critical. Wells informs Supergirl, and tells Kara she needs to fly her high above, outside Earth's atmosphere, otherwise she exploding will level Central City and more. Kara flies up, and Overgirl explodes as she reaches space. Dark Arrow witnesses the explosion, and is devastated over the death of his wife, falling to his knees. Oliver pulls an arrow, ready to shoot him. Dark Arrow rises with fury, swears to kill Oliver, but just as he assaults, Oliver shoots him in the heart, killing him. The Nazi invasion from Earth-X to Earth-1 is over. Kara drops down to Earth, and seemingly hits the ground hard, forming a small crater. But in reality, she was caught in arms by Nate, in his Steel form, and he quips that he figured "it would take the Man of Steel to catch the Girl of Steel".
                              
                              All members of Team Arrow, Team Flash, Legends, Kara, Alex, Leo and Ray gather at Stein's funeral, where Jax holds a eulogy. He breaks down and is devastated that he couldn't save him, as he only wanted to come home to Clarissa and Lily and little Ronnie. But Clarissa says Jax was his family too. As his grave is being filled, many people say their goodbyes: Clarissa says farewell to her loving husband, Lily says farewell to a great father, Sara thanks him for believing in her, Caitlin tells him to tell Ronnie she misses him. Mick also sheds tears for Stein, which Leo witnesses, but Mick claims it's just allergies.
                              
                              After the funeral, Cisco opens a breach for Ray and Leo to return to Earth-X. However, Leo decides to stick around on Earth-1 for awhile, and kisses Ray goodbye, promising to return. In the central park of Central City, Alex meets with Sara one last time and Sara encourages her to follow her instincts and believe there is someone else for her. The two women part as friends, with Sara boarding the Waverider for a next time traveling adventure. Kara arrives alongside Oliver, Barry, Felicity and Iris. Kara is sorry that Barry and Iris' wedding didn't go as they wanted, but they are going to do it lightly. Kara hugs Barry, Felicity and Iris, but with Oliver she does a fist bump, remembering Oliver is not one for hugs. However, Alex does hug him. Kara and Alex return through a breach to Earth-38. Barry and Iris then want to be married right now, and Oliver knows someone, who can help with that. Barry runs to Star City and grabs John Diggle from the Arrowcave and brings him to Central City (with Diggle vomiting yet again). As Diggle married his brother, Andy, and his wife, Carly, years ago, he has the authority to wed others. Barry and Iris go through their marriage vows with Oliver and Felicity as witnesses. As John is about pronounce the marriage, Felicity stops him, and asks that he marry her and Oliver right here and now as well. Oliver is surprised, but the war with Earth-X made Felicity realize she wants to be with Oliver and help him with William and everything else. They don't make vows, but they say "I do". John then pronounces Oliver Jonas Queen and Felicity Megan Smoak, Bartholomew Henry Allen and Iris Ann West as husband and wife.</div>

                                At the DEO, the gathering is discussing the 31st century with Mon-El and Imra. The last advises that her gathering â€” the Legion of Super-Heroes â€” were established to carry on Supergirl's strategic. Mon-El clarifies they erroneously went back in time, and he needs the DEO's assistance of fixing their ship so they can return into what's to come.
                                
                                Kara welcomes Mon-El and Imra over to her loft for a vacation party, yet the couple decays the welcome.
                                
                                The majority of the DEO team is there including J'onn, Alex, and Winn, as is Lena Luthor and James Olsen just as J'onn's father M'yrnn. There's a thump at the entryway and it's Samantha and Ruby; they're running late.
                                
                                Samantha grumbles of a harsh day at work while Alex pulls Ruby out of the way to address inquiries concerning working with Supergirl.
                                
                                Samantha begins drinking scotch with Lena and prods her supervisor about having a throw with James. Kara concurs that she sees the science among James and Lana too. J'onn approaches Kara and discloses to her he's gotten a call, and they need to go.
                                
                                The two go to a consumed field, and Kara flies up to get a bird's-eye see. She sees a logo consumed into the fields â€” it's the logo of Reign.
                                
                                Kara approaches the multi dimensional image of her mom about the token she saw consumed into the ground. She discovers that the image is Kryptonian, however discovers there isn't a definite interpretation of the logo.
                                
                                At CatCo, James is sitting in front of the TV sets where the news is showing reports that the city has been vandalized with different cycles of the Reign seal. Lena strolls in and reveals to James that he believes that Morgan Edge is behind the vandalism.

                                Mon-El and Imra are out having Christmas Eve supper, and Kara and Winn appear. Seeing that Kara needs to address Mon-El alone, Winn pulls Imra aside for a brew. While she's conversing with Mon-El, Kara gets a gather call from Albatross Bay Correctional.
                                
                                Kara appears and we discover that it was Thomas Coville â€” the minister the lead the Cult of Rao â€” who called her. He's murmuring different Kryptonian-like platitudes before turning upward and revealing to Kara she has a long way to go.
                                
                                Coville clarifies that the end is close, and that it's Kara's motivation to battle the fallen angel. Kara clarifies that the fiend isn't genuine, however she appears to be reluctant in her own convictions.
                                
                                Samantha's working at CatCo, and Ruby is ravenous and needs to go eat. Samantha clarifies that she's too occupied to even think about going out so the family babysitter will get Ruby. A resentful Ruby is in the long run quieted down after Samantha converses with her around a couple of the recollections the two offer. Samantha then gives Ruby a present; a neckband of the Supergirl seal.
                                
                                Kara's conversing with the group at the DEO about Coville's call, and Imra strolls in and says she can help. Imra pulls Kara aside to converse with her about Kara's past with Mon-El. Imra consoles her that Mon-El didn't proceed onward from Kara gently.

                                We see a medication bargain going somewhere around the docks when the lights begin going out. The street pharmacists are taken out by individually by a concealed figure until the last vendor begins fleeing. He's in the long run halted by the shadowy figure, as we see through the figure's first-individual perspective.
                                
                                Back at her office, Lena and James are attempting to do some exploration on the man who pursued them. They uncover that the shooter recently worked for a meeting Morgan Edge used to work for.

                                Mon-El apologizing to Kara, that Imra was not her intention to upset her but kara made it clear that she didn't do anything wrong. Kara tells Mon-El she's kind and generous eventhough she looks like a greek goddess and tells she can't find any reason to hate her. She made clear to him that at least two of us still gets be happy. While Kara explaining to Mon-El, She feels she is the third wheel with a heavy heartbreak when Irma is around with Mon-El. She is trying to be okay with Mon-el loving Irma more than her before who leaves since she says since she no longer observes love in his eyes when he is looking at her .

                                Morgan Edge assembles a public interview, where he tells columnists that he was assaulted by somebody. He explicitly makes reference to that he can't be sure that is wasn't Supergirl who assaulted him.

                                                          <div class="box">As the terraforming of Earth goes on, National City and the Earth are hit by a number of different natural disasters. Supergirl, Mon-El, Guardian, Alex and Alura help out people in any way they can. Superman is also helping out elsewhere. They get support from Imra and Brainy, as Imra shields a large water spout, which Kara and Alura freeze, and Brainy destroys. Guoardian heads to a burning building, where a panicked mother is trying to head back to save her son. Guardian takes off his mask to calm her down and saves the boy. Meanwhile, J'onn and M'yrnn arrive at a fissure in Madagascar, where M'yrnn intends to commune with Earth to stop Reign. He shows one last memory to J'onn: the story of Martian scrolls. J'onn is in tears, as M'yrnn will not survive this ordeal, but M'yrnn assures him he will never be gone, and tells his son to live as he has. He then uses the Staff of Kolar to phase into Earth's core. Reign is stopped as a result, and disaster is averted. The Children of Juru are baffled about, what just happened.

                                                            Meanwhile, Samantha is in Juru, attempting to reach the Fountains of Lillith, in order to gain the necessary power to destroy Reign for good. She encounters Patricia, but she refuses to listen to her, thinking it's a trick. She reaches the fountain, but Patricia stops her from drinking, as Samantha was just about to drink from the wrong fountain. Samantha refuses to listen. Patricia then asks Samantha to trust her, and drink from the real fountain. In the end, Samantha reluctantly drinks from it.
                                                            
                                                            The Children of Juru try to open the hole in order to get Reign back, but the fail to notice Coville is still alive. He sees J'onn's spaceship, and quietly tries to reach it.
                                                            
                                                            At the DEO, Mon-El and Kara talk until Imra arrives. Mon-El thanks Imra for coming, but she tells him that being away from him has made her realize their marriage was never what it should have been, and they annul their marriage, but remain as friends and teammates. Later, Mon-El is sitting in the conference room and Winn tries to talk with him, but Brainy comes to tell them both the future needs them both. Even though the Legion stopped the birth of Blight, a new threat in the form of Brainy's distant relative will come to terrorize the future. And Brainy's presence as a 12th level intellect would be too risky for him to be there. So he tells Winn to takes his place in the Legion, as his intellect, while small compared to Brainy, is exactly what is needed to fight this threat. Winn claims he's not up for something like that, as he made something that couldn't save anyone. But Brainy then shows him the drawing he made, and reveals that in the 31st century, it is regarded as an artifact, as it serves as the basis of many technological breakthroughs in the future technology. Because of it, that technology has saved millions of lives Winn finds that hard to believe.
                                                            
                                                            James comes to see Winn, who is still unsure what he should do. James tells that he took off his mask, and found some clarity. Meanwhile, in the Sanctuary, Reign finally resurfaces and is willing to try again. However, none in the sanctuary saw Coville, who managed to activate the homing beacon on J'onn's ship just before dying. The signal from the beacon is picked up at the DEO, and Kara tells everybody this will be the last battle. Lena and Alex still watch over Samantha, who still hasn't woken up, or gained powers. In Juru, Samantha is still drinking from te fountain, but is finding it more and more difficult. Through Patricia's encouragement, she manages to take one last sip. She feels the power, and finally believes she really is talking with her adoptive mother. Patricia apologizes to Samantha for all the bad things she did to her, but Samantha forgives her. Right after Kara, J'onn, Alura, Imra and Brainy leave, Samantha wakes up, and floats in the air, stunning Lena and Alex. Ruby is also happy and proud of her mother. Samantha asks, where is Supergirl. Lena and Alex tell her she and the others already left, but she goes after them with her new powers.
                                                            
                                                            As the Children of Juru and Reign prepare for another attempt, Reign hears the Legion ship. Kara, J'onn, Mon-El and Alura arrive and a battle begins. Supergirl and Reign fight outside, while others defeat and chain the witches. However, Reign ultimately proves too powerful for Kara, and is about to strangle her, when Samantha arrives, wielding the Sword of Juru. She plunges it to Reign, and Kara then throws her into the hole. But before dying, Reign unleashes a number of superpowered heat visions on others, which causes Mon-El, Alura and Samantha to die. J'onn is also hit, but he survives barely. Heartbroken over the deaths, she laments herself for allowing herself to use lethal force. As she speaks to J'onn, she then recalls how Harun-El split Samantha and Reign, and realizes it can also reunite them. Then she remembers Mon-El's ring, and asks Alex and Lena to find her a time disruption, so she can go back in time, and do it over. She flies into it and sees visions and hears the words of her loved ones from her past. She then reaches the moment just before Samantha struck the sword into Reign. She stops Samantha, knocks Reign on the ground and tells Mon-El to throw her the Harun-El. She catches it, puts it into Reign's hand, and tells Samantha to touch it. All three end up in Juru, where Samantha beats Reign, and forces her to drink from the Fountain of Weakness. With this done, the ghosts of Juru grab Reign, and drag her into the fountain, banishing her forever.
                                                            
                                                            Everyone return to DEO, where Winn has agreed to join the Legion and go to the future. Kara and Mon-El talk and finally they both get a closure about their relationship: they would always love each other, but the duty they have in their own times is more important. Kara also has come to terms, that Earth is her home now, even though being in Argo City was like being in home, but something was missing there. In there, she could be Kara Zor-El, but not Supergirl or Kara Danvers, as it is these three identities that make her who she is. Kara and Mon-El goodbye in good terms, and Mon-El gives her his ring to remember him, just like Kara gave him her necklace. The DEO then say goodbye to Winn, with Alex and Kara crying over his leave, and Kara acknowledges that Winn is a hero. Alura leaves back to Argo City, saying goodbye to her daughter. Lena also gives her the remaining Harun-El and a recipe to make it, to ensure Argo City's survival. Alex goes to see J'onn and is about to resign from the DEO, due to her desire to be a mother, but J'onn denies it, and instead promotes Alex to Director of the DEO. J'onn intends to leave and do what M'yrnn wanted him to do.
                                                            
                                                            The next day, Alex and Lena meet Samantha and reveal that she is now 100% human, with no trace of Kryptonian DNA in her. Samantha thanks them and Alex particularly for being there for Ruby. J'onn puts a hat on and walks in the streets of National City. In a news report, James publicly reveals his identity as Guardian. In Kara's apartment, Kara and Alex eat pizza and discuss everything have happened, with Kara deciding to stay on Earth. Alex wonders are they going to be okay and Kara assures they will be.
                                                            
                                                            Lena is in her lab studying Harun-El with Eve, revealing she didn't give it all away.
                                                            
                                                            Going back 48 hours, as Kara, Reign and Samantha touched the Harun-El, a black mist escaped into the sky without anyone noticing. The mist eventually reaches the Siberian border. In a Russian military base, soldiers see someone walking towards the base. As the person enters the light, it is a young woman, a perfect copy of Kara, created by Harun-El.</div>
