        <h1>Supergirl: Season 6: Episode 1: "Rebirth"</h1>
        <div class="box">Dreamer finds Querl Dox dying in the Leviathan ship; the Superfriends arrive just as Gamemnae attacks Brainy and Dreamer. The Martians and the Kryptonian are not as vulnerable to the ship's radiation, so they fight Gamemnae. Brainy tells Alex Danvers that the Anti-life equation is needed to stop Gamemnae, so Alex works with Supergirl to deliver the program and destroy the technological Jarhanpurian before the ship is destroyed.

          Meanwhile, the powers of the other Jarhanpurians are absorbed by Lex Luthor as Lillian Luthor observes his vital signs and progress. Lex plans to "fix" every planet in the universe, after he makes Humans loyal to him through the "I Love Lexi" program that he installed in the satellites that he had launched months ago. Lillian, though already immune to the program, forces Lex to make Lena immune as well.
          
          When the Superfriends return to the Tower, they learn that Eve Teschmacher has agreed to give William Dey an exclusive interview about everything she knows about Lex's plans. Lena reveals that Project Non Nocere was reprogrammed by Lex. Suddenly, Dreamer has a vision of Lex as the new Anti-Monitor. M'gann M'orzz proposes to use a Martian ritual that would link her with J'onn J'onzz so that they can destroy Lex's satellites. Since Lena and Kara are amicable again, Kara proposes that Lena uses Myriad to deprogram anyone affected by "I Love Lexi" and Kelly Olsen is teamed with Lena. Jarhanpurium is the needed element that would weaken the newly-immortal Lex. Knowing Lex's obsession to kill Kryptonians, Supergirl offers to act as a distraction at the Fortress of Solitude until the others can enact the plan.

          At CatCo, Andrea Rojas cries, because her father has publicly denounced her leadership of Obsidian North and has set the company towards bankruptcy.
          
          Brainy explains to Nia why he had hurt her for months and the two decide to mend their relationship.
          
          Andrea transforms into Acrata and saves CatCo by hacking her father's computer in Buenos Aires and having him buy all of the failing company's stocks.
          
          While in the Fortress, Supergirl makes a video as a will. As everyone enacts their portion of the plan, Lex arrives at the Fortress and poisons Supergirl. Dreamer and Alex defeat Otis Graves and Lillian to get the bottle with the Jarhanpurians. Ultimately, the Superfriends defeat Lex, but as a last ditch effort, Lex fires a Phantom Zone projector and expels Supergirl to the Phantom Zone.

          At the Tower, Alex is given the code name "Sentinel".
          
          Lena uses Myriad to make Lillian and Lex forget Supergirl's secret identity, after Lex threatens the lives of Kelly and Eliza Danvers if he were put in jail.
          
          Supergirl awakens to find herself surrounded by Phantoms.</div>
          <hr>
          <h1>Supergirl: Season 6: Episode 2: "A Few Good Women"</h1>
          <div class="box">The trial of Lex Luthor for crimes against humanity was upcoming; though Lillian Luthor wanted Lex to just plea guilty to salvage the Luthor family name, Lex disagreed and wanted the truth to be known.

            Meanwhile, the Superfriends had researched a Transilvane named Silas who was once able to traverse the Phantom Zone in search for his husband Owen. The heroes captured him as he was trying to rob a Luthor Foundation blood bank and requested that he build a portal to the dimension to free Supergirl.
            
            In the Phantom Zone, Kara is assaulted by Phantoms who feed on the hope of escape; she is sheltered, however, by a man who recognizes and wears the glyph of the House of El, her own father, Zor-El, who escaped the destruction of Krypton by coming here. Though happy to be reunited, Kara is adamant in leaving. When she attempts again, the phantoms attack again, causing Zor-El to save her again.
            
            Andrea Rojas wants to avenge the folding of Obsidian North and the financial woes of CatCo by seeing Lex crucified in the media and in court. She assigns William Dey to the story but security is too restrictive for him to get any interviews or to even be within the virtual courtroom. Only lawyers, security, and witnesses are allowed. When Andrea pursues an interview from Lena she is rejected. Eve Teschmacher is the prosecution's star witness but Lex, as his own defense attorney, makes Eve's testimony unreliable by painting her as a jilted lover with an image inducer and her own motives.
            
            Lillian sells her shares of Luthor Corp to Lena and convinces Lena to take the stand against Lex. Lena tries to razzle Lex by making him brag about his intellectual superiority, but he tells the truth and tries to get jury to be sympathetic with his desire to rule humanity. Silas tries to get the Superfriends to understand that it took him years to develop the technology needed to traverse the Phantom Zone, but J'onn J'onzz is not patient and wants his surrogate daughter found, causing M'gann M'orzz to have a serious talk with him about his emotions. As Kelly Olsen emotionally supports Silas, Alex Danvers has unhealthy expectations as well.

            Querl Dox trains Nia Nal in new ways to use her powers so that she can search the dimension for their friend.
            
            Silas succeeds in opening the gate, but due to the Anti-Monitor Crisis, the Phantom Zone has changed and finding Kara is now much harder than they imagined. Phantoms take the opportunity to cross the divide and attack the heroes, but they are repelled. After the battle, Alex has an emotional breakdown.
            
            Lex is acquitted of his charges and released; he sees his mother for a celebratory game of chess and realizes that the truth set him free.
            
            Kara convinces her father to help her to escape the dimensional prison. On their journey, they see phantoms entering a portal. Zor-El explains that only phantoms can enter such riffs, causing Kara and him to decide to capture a phantom.
            
            William is disillusioned after Lex's acquittal; Nia tries to encourage him.
            
            Andrea sees Lena and the two know that Lex is their common foe in the times ahead.</div>
            <hr>
            <h1>Supergirl: Season 6: Episode 3: "Phantom Menaces"</h1>
            <div class="box">Lena Luthor, now in charge of Luthor Corp, asks Querl Dox for help in banning Lex Luthor from the company's computers.

              Meanwhile, Silas has called J'onn J'onzz and M'gann M'orzz because he was possessed by Prime Phantom who has exited his body and scratched him and his roommates at his apartment.
              
              In the Phantom Zone, Supergirl has broken her leg; she and Zor-El hitched a ride on a phantom through a portal and upon exiting, she fell hard upon the ground. As she struggled in pain, bandits kidnapped Zor-El. Kara would have been taken as well but Nyxly tricked them into leaving without her.
              
              After Nyxly and Kara exchange origin stories and trust, Nyxly explains to Kara that the bandits sacrifice people to a beast they fear. As Kara rests to prepare to raid the bandits' cave, Nyxly regains her magical powers, heals Kara's leg, and prepares for the confrontation. Lex is not pleased because Lena is slowing the deals that he is making with Kasnia, so he confronts her and tells her that he is having District attorney Matthews investigate her for her part in Project Non Nocere to get her to relinquish control.

              Alex Danvers sits in her apartment and cries as she watches Kara's video will, but Kelly Olsen talks to her and gets Alex to help with the diagnosis of Silas who, in the Tower, loses his soul and transforms into a phantom. The sight of the transformation triggers Alex's PTSD.
              
              Acting as the leader of the Superfriends and missing Kara but trying not to be too emotional, J'onn gives M'gann commands not to chase phantoms on her own. M'gann responds by going anyway when the police are alerted that phantoms are attacking citizens. By the time the other Superfriends arrived on the scene of the attacks, M'gann was infected.
              
              Lena and Querl transfer some of Lex's money to a children's hospital; Lex gets Otis Graves to bomb the place and to tell the press that Lena was in charge of the place's faulty wiring. Lena wishes Lex death, but Brainy takes the suggestion seriously. Lena talks Brainy who is filled with rage out of his emotional breakdown and she realizes that she needs to end her toxic relationship with her brother. J'onn literally has a piece of M'gann's soul; when M'gann transforms into a phantom, the Superfriends transfer that piece back to M'gann to revert to normal. This inspires Alex to ask Kelly to live with her permanently.

              Lena ends her war with Lex by declaring him the winner and telling him that he has sole possession of Luthor Corp. Lex tells his butler that even though he has everything he wants, he still wants more.
              
              After a relatively easy confrontation with Scar's bandits to free Zor-El, Kara reveals that Alura Zor-El created the Phantom Zone, so there must be a hidden passage for escape that they will find.</div>
              <hr>
              <h1>Supergirl: Season 6: Episode 4: "Lost Souls"</h1>
              <div class="box">Supergirl, Nyxly and Zor-El come out of one of her portals in another part of the Phantom Zone. Zor-El is worried about the effect the frequent encounters with Phantoms is having on his daughter. Nyxly cuts the conversation short by pointing to a gleaming structure in the distance: They've found the Anchor.

                Back at the Tower, M'gann is still recovering and has a nightmare about the Phantoms. Alex, John and Brainiac discuss the number of Phantoms they've encountered lately while Dreamer gives Lena a tour. M'gann joins them and tells them about the nightmare. Brainiac notes that part of her soul is still in the Phantom Hive Mind and they realise being part-Phantom will allow her to track Supergirl. Lena reveals a modified ProtoGun she's been working on which she dubs the ProtoTrap: It will transport the target straight into containment. They detect a cold front at Grand Central Station and J'onn, M'gann, Dreamer and Brainy go to check it out, with Brainy taking the ProtoTrap.
                
                At the station, they find the Phantom attacking a barrista. Brainiac uses the ProtoTrap to capture it but the barrista has already been infected and her life force leaves her body. M'gann follows it, with J'onn going after her. Dreamer has another flash of Kara and Alex at Midvale. The barrista turns into a Phantom and the Prime Phantom arrives through a portal. Brainy hits him with the ProtoTrap but he's grown too strong for it. He and the other Phantom portal out. M'gann collapses during her pursuit and J'onn captures her.
                
                Supergirl manages to force open the door to the Anchor even without super-strength. They search for the exit: a mirror that activates only for the righteous and will show them an image of their home that they can walk through it to. They find it but it's been smashed. Zor-El is set to give up but Supergirl helps him realises that Alura wouldn't have risked trapping the guards there: There would be a second mirror in the supply room at the barracks.
                
                M'gann says she felt weak and started to turn back into a Progeny. Brainiac notes that as the two parts of her soul got closer they cancelled each other out. Destroying the chrysalis where the life forces are imprisoned would return everyone to normal, but Brainiac suddenly realises that if M'gann gets her original soul back, she won't be able to track Supergirl anymore. J'onn insists that stopping the Phantoms spreading has to be their priority: If the chrysalis becomes too strong, they'll never be able to break it and Earth will become a new Phantom Zone. Alex wants to do both and Lena suggests a way of replicating M'gann's sensory powers.
                
                Alex and Lena work on a way of using Q-waves to replicate M'gann's powers, like Lena once did with Malefic. Lena notes they need a sample of Kara's DNA. Nia and Brainy discuss her visions of Midvale and his comfort eating.
                
                Supergirl and the others are searching for the second mirror. Zor-El calls out that he's found it and then cries out in pain. Supergirl finds him with an injured leg: He says Scar attacked him and Nyxly says she drove him off. Zor-El is unable to walk with a broken ankle and it will take two to carry the mirror, so he convinces the others to go and install it and then come back for him.
                
                Alex shows Lena Supergirl's crystal message, explaining the crystal contains her digital life force. Lena points out extracting it will erase the message but Alex is willing to risk it. Dreamer and M'gann combine their powers. Dreamer is briefly distracted by a flash of Kara, Alex and Kenny, but manages to see the chrysalis, not quite solid. However, she is driven off by Phantoms before she can work out where it is. Brainiac notes from what she saw they have an hour before the chrysalis becomes unbreakable. M'gann is willing to track it even if it means becoming a Phantom but Alex says there's another way. She tells Lena they need to recalibrate her device to track the Phantoms, but that will mean erasing Kara's DNA. Lena is desperate to get Kara back, blaming her actions for Lex trapping Kara. Alex says Kara already forgave Lena for working against her and they need to follow up her example and put other people first. When Lena still hesitates, Alex takes the device off her.
                
                Supergirl and Nyxly install the mirror, which shows an image of the Fortress. Kara prepares to go back for Zor-El but Nyxly tries to convince her to leave him, saying he's been holding her back and comparing him to her own father. She also reveals she attacked him disguised as Scar and Supergirl realises Nyxly needed her to activate the portal. Nyxly points out she will have to go through the portal to Earth in order to reach the Fifth Dimension and intends to have "fun" while she's there.
                
                Sentinel, J'onn, Dreamer and Brainy track the Phantoms' lair to the sewers. J'onn and Brainiac are both attacked by Phantoms and infected. Sentinel and Dreamer find the chrysalis, guarded by Phantoms. Dreamer uses her powers to clear a path to it and Sentinel smashes it, releasing the life forces. All the Phantoms, including the barrista, Silas and the others in containment, return to normal, diminishing the Prime Phantom. Dreamer and J'onn hit him with their powers and Brainiac captures him with the ProtoTrap.
                
                Supergirl and Nyxly fight in the control room, causing enough damage to trigger the self-destruct countdown. Nyxly refuses to leave by any way except the exit mirror. Supergirl grabs a mace and smashes it. Nyxly sinks to her knees in despair, refusing to leave. Supergirl flees the control room as it explodes.
                
                Lena apologises to Alex for defying her and questions whether she really fits in with the Super-Friends, saying she's not a hero like them. Alex says they're all different from each other and they couldn't have succeeded without Lena. Brainy and Nia ponder the fact they're at square one with regards finding Supergirl and what Nia's flashes mean. J'onn and M'gann monitor the Prime Phantom in containment. Lena and Brainiac realise the Prime would track Supergirl if given a sample of her DNA, which could only be gathered if she was weakened by a solar flare or kryptonite. M'gann asks Alex how many times Kara has blown out her powers and she says the only times were when fighting Red Tornado and once in high school. Brainiac and Nia realise that's what the dreams meant: They have to go back in time to Midvale High.
                
                Back in the Phantom Zone, Supergirl takes cover as the Anchor explodes completely.</div>
                <hr>
                <h1>Supergirl: Season 6: Episode 5: "Prom Night!"</h1>
                <div class="box">The scene opens with Brainy and Nia sorting out the particular area of Kara's DNA in 2009, DNA that they need to save Kara from the Phantom Zone. A news section likewise noticed that Midvale is the "most fortunate" town and it's uncovered that in this timetable, Kara's beau Kenny was never killed and J'onn proposes he ought to return with Nia and Brainy because of sudden contrasts, however Brainy says no as it is excessively dangerous. Nia acknowledges returning to 2009 places her in when her mom was as yet alive while Brainy is somewhat apprehensive about getting the time travel right.

                  In 2009, Alex and Kara make up for lost time and Kara is slowing down on revealing to Kenny that she's intending to go to National City for school rather than the school she wanted to go to with Kenny. She catches Brainy's boat crash at the baseball field and Alex drives them by and large present. As they leave, they pass Cat Grant who is there to do a story on Midvale.
                  
                  Nia and Brainy have shown up in Midvale a day ahead of schedule and are found by Kara, Kenny and Alex. They rapidly guarantee that they are clairvoyant outsiders from the planet Psycon and make a terrible showing of covering for themselves. They should try not to connect with Alex and Kara. Kara needs to help the "outsiders" yet Alex thinks it is an issue. Kara winds up acquainting herself with Brainy (calling himself Brandon) and Nia (calling herself Brenda) and offering to help. With the specialists coming, Kara begins to shroud the boat, yet Nia and Brainy rapidly assume control over, hiding it under the baseball field. Kenny takes Brainy home with him, Nia returns home with the Danvers young ladies.
                  
                  At Kenny's, Brainy oddities out a piece when he understands that doesn't approach a 3D printer however Kenny has a strong arrangement that expects them to go to the school. At Kara's, Nia and Kara bond a piece, yet Nia battles with missing her mom who she knows is alive in 2009. Afterward, Nia has a fantasy including a confined purple wild feline who gets away from that is some way or another additionally associated with Midvale High.
                  
                  At school, Kenny and Brainy talk while he chips away at the 3D printer. Kenny says he's constructed a base for himself and Kara. Kenny goes to class and advises Brainy not to leave the lab, but rather it takes a long effort to print and he runs out of tidbits so he escapes to the bite machine where he's spotted by the Glee club teacher and taken off to class. Kenny later discovers him on the baseball field as Brainy has been enrolled by basically everybody.
                  
                  Feline circumvents Midvale, persuaded that there is a "super" being behind things in Midvale so she goes searching for her story. She experiences Alex with her mom's identification to meet, recognizing herself as CJ Grant. Alex reveals to her that nothing in Midvale merits finding. Nia and Kara track down the mineral that they need. In transit home, the young ladies are nearly taken out by a gas truck with no driver.
                  
                  Prior in the scene, it's uncovered that a couple of outsiders choose to make a beeline for Earth to catch a Kryptonian – which means Kara. Incidentally, the outsiders are behind the runaway truck, attempting to draw out a Kryptonian. Kara and Nia get into the truck and figure out how to get it to quit, making the outsiders miss their shot. The outsiders are currently mindful that there is a Naltorian and a Coluan too yet they withdraw without taking anybody. Feline, in any case, is close by and sees that something abnormal has occurred, however she doesn't really get them in the demonstration.
                  
                  Nia battles to sort out her fantasy. Alone on the boat, Nia calls her mom, yet gets her phone message. Intelligent sorts out who the outsiders are who are after them are, which assist Nia with interpreting her fantasy yet they're appalled to find that their activities have now changed the timetable and the outsider, Naxim, is unhindered.
                  
                  At the Danvers home, Alex and Kara squabble about telling their mom and Alex uncovers that the family has forfeited for Kara - including Alex's outing to Europe. Kara then, at that point heads out to at last reveal to Kenny that she's intending to go to National City, yet he shows her the legend base he's made her.
                  
                  Intelligent is blowing a gasket about the course of events change, and discovering that Nia called her mother and can't adapt. He gets Nia to share her way of dealing with stress, which is singing Dolly Parton's "9-5". The PC finds Naxim and they discover the boat, however Naxim is sitting tight for them and he gets them.</div>

                  <h1>Supergirl: Season 6: Episode 6: "Prom Again!"</h1>
                  <div class="box">The episode picks up where "Prom Night!" left off, with Nia and Brainy trapped by the aliens. However, Kara hears them in distress and goes to their aid. In the scuffle, Nia and Brainy get free and manage to stop the aliens. However, Cat's been watching and recording the whole thing via drone.

                    With Brainy and Nia free, they claim they are ready to leave and Kenny and Kara have to get ready for prom. Brainy later tells Nia that he set the aliens on course to Uruguay so they can reset space time. However, Nia then has a dream of the cage and the cat again, but Brainy thinks it must just be a dream echo.
                    
                    Cat, determined to find her story, starts throwing rocks out in the clearing until she uncovers the ships and starts pressing buttons until she releases the aliens. They take her onto her ship and lock her up in one of their cells.
                    
                    Alex drives Kara to prom and the sisters have a heartfelt chat in the car. Alex tells her she's proud of her and apologizes for how she's behaved lately. She now realizes that Kara can handle anything. She also tells Kara that because she has to wear a mask every day, she should take the night off and not wear a mask to the prom. Alex then goes to photograph the meteor shower.
                    
                    On the time ship, Nia and Brainy share a dance before prom.
                    
                    At the school, the meteor shower starts, interrupting Kara from talking to Kenny. She takes off to stop the meteor from hitting the school, something that Alex witnesses. The meteor is made of kryptonite, though, and Kara falls from the sky and lands in the gym, alive but weakened by kryptonite. As they're sorting things out, the aliens broadcast a message demanding that the aliens reveal themselves or else. Kenny claims to be the Kryptonian and the aliens take him before vanishing.
                    
                    The aliens figure out that Kenny is human and that he sacrificed himself for his friend so now they plan to use him as bait and throw him in a cell with Cat. Naxim sends a message to the aliens and says that the Kryptonian has 10 minutes to turn themselves over or they will kill Kenny. Nia and Brainy subdue Kara and then take off themselves to go find Kenny.
                    
                    Alex takes the Kryptonite shards out of Kara's hand and after talking -- with Alex warning her that she will never get to be normal again if she gets caught -- Alex, picks the lock to the janitor's closet they're stuck in so that Kara can get into natural light. A recharged Kara takes off. Nia has another dream, this time, she holds off the cougar so that she can try to read the cage for details, discerning the letters P. W. She loses control of things and comes out of the dream, but brings the cougar with her, sending it chasing the aliens, a power Brainy calls lucid dreaming. When they get on the ship, they realize that the cougar from Nia's dreams is actually about Cat.
                    
                    Kara shows up at the ship and in a scuffle they end up releasing all the aliens that have been captive on board. Cat escapes, and the police show up just as Naxim and his sidekick escape. Brainy and Nia watch in horror as Kara is confronted by Cat and the cops, realizing that the timeline has been altered and it can't be undone. Nia says they can use the time ship to go back in time to fix it, going back just a few hours so they can stop Cat. Kara overhears and breaks out of police custody and flies off.
                    
                    Nia and Brainy go back in time a few hours and prepare to change things, but quickly discover that they aren't alone. Kara has stowed away with them. She tells them that she realizes that she doesn't want her future to be tangled up with cops and reporters so she wants to change things back. With time of the essence, they agree to let her help, but they accidentally come in contact with Alex and Kenny. Nia finds Cat's drone and shoots it down and then comes face to face with Cat. Nia ends up giving Cat a peptalk, telling her she's a visionary and even sets her on the path to calling herself Cat rather than CJ. With that out of the way, the timeline resets itself.
                    
                    An inspired Cat quits her job at The Daily Planet and begins to draft her plans for CatCo -- with the logo inspired by the cougar from Nia's dream. Naxim's ship sends a surrender beacon to the DEO and flies off. The meteor shower happens and again, Kara responds. She's downed by the Kryptonite and while waiting for Alex to get the car to take her home, Kara and Kenny have a serious conversation about their future, with Kara telling him she's going to National City University. Brainy and Nia get the rock with Kara's blood and head home.</div>

They figure the imprisoned Prime Phantom's Q-Waves will lead them to Kara once they enter the Zone. J'onn warns that if they encounter more Phantoms, they can't use the same methods to fight them. In their native dimension, the Phantoms attack with Fear Visions. Kelly figures that her fear management techniques can help them, and explains about grounding.

Supergirl closes down the analyst's machine however the tempest seethes on. Supergirl advises Lena to deliver the symbol to stop the tempest as she needs her group utilitarian. Nyxly gets the emblem.

Kara then, at that point, tells Lena that William will be implanted with the Super Friends. Kelly likewise tells the group that she has an arrangement to mind one of the cultivate children and Kara begins snickering wildly in light of the fact that Nyxly is cheerful.

They let him know the guidelines: don't uncover the Tower area, don't uncover personalities or attempt to think that they are out, shown stories to them prior to recording them. Nyxly's boat then, at that point, appears over the city. Ends up, the emblem is ridiculously simple to get. Nyxly takes it from a contender at a match and claims it, yet when Supergirl appears, Nyxly spreads a type of energy making everybody begin battling. It's turned individuals corrupted.

Lena believes she's discovered a spell in her mom's book that will allow them to follow her. William requests to talk with Supergirl. He needs to tell the public going on, report the circumstance with Nyxly. Supergirl needs him not to in light of the fact that Nyxly doesn't realize that they have enchantment on their side, as well. She then, at that point, takes off, hearing somebody shouting out for help. Notwithstanding, Andrea is forcing William to uncover all at this point. She's even hacked his PC. She advises him to return with what she needs or not under any condition.
                                          
                                          Lena and Nia work on Lena's enchantment, explicitly attempting to get the spell to work yet it appears to have blown up as Nia currently doesn't have a clue about her headings. Supergirl is out of nowhere overpowered with one more of Nyxly's sentiments, empathy. On Mitch's boat, Nyxly out of nowhere appears to have a huge load of empathy for Mitch. She is energized, believing that things might be extremely accommodating forward. They obtain some much needed education concerning where the following emblem is, and it's in the Netherlands. William visits Lena and she discloses how she's attempting to manage her mom's spellbook.

Lena sorts out she needs a particular element briefly that is at the professional flowerbed.

Ends up, the spell intensifies the strength instead of fills in as a reference point. Nyxly begins to understand that the Humanity Totem itself is the test and she has the entirety of the sympathy and compassion of individuals in the impact range. Mitch proposes that there must be a way of getting the Hope Totem without harming anybody so they can continue to go ahead. Supergirl is additionally feeling those sentiments so she's currently mindful of the Humanity Totem's uncommon gauntlet. Supergirl believes that in the event that they overpower Nyxly by utilizing Lena's spell once more, it would end everything except Lena will not do it as she considers releasing to be a lot of corruption as off-base.

Supergirl recovers the emblem and Nyxly has Mitch fly the boat out of there instead of manage her. With enough particles passed on to follow one emblem, the Super Friends choose to follow the Dream Totem as Dreamer could possibly assist with that. At CatCo, Andrea is satisfied with William's article however needs him to uncover individual data just as the area of the Tower. William says no and that he will compose the tales his way and in the event that she doesn't care for it, he can offer them to The Daily Planet.

They let her experience their companions' forces, yet try too hard to where she says she ought to return. With the assistance of a Truth Seeker, they promise Esme that they won't ever forsake her. Nyxly distinguishes the Totem of Hope, and track down that to utilize it they should "rouse trust more splendid than the sun". Thinking this a task for Supergirl, Nyxly plans to coerce both the Hope and Humanity tokens by abducting William. Nyxly's actuation of the emblem compounds a debate among Kaznia and another country, prompting atomic conflict. Supergirl incapacitates the two countries, finishing her assessment by moving expectation, and with William's assistance salvages him and gets each of the three stones. She sends the Hope symbol into the sun, so that Nyxly can never join each of the seven emblems.

Since things are quiet, Supergirl reveals a plan to do an interview with President Zakharov of Kaznia and Prime Minister Perez of Corto Maltese about a forthcoming peace treaty between their people. Kara has a hard time pitching the idea to Andrea but eventually Andrea works out a way to make it appeal to her audience.

She brushes aside Maeve's attempt at an apology for what she said when they last met but tells her about the Dream Totem. Maeve has heard of it, but thought it was a legend, and points to the large number of books with information on it.
                                            
                                            Nyxly discovers that the Lexosuit contains an AI that appears to be Nyxly herself. William offers to help Kara with a mock interview but she is called away when Nyxly is sighted. The AI leads Nyxly to the Dream Institute where a scientist, Dr. Pavoni, has found a way to access people's dreams. The AI can help Nyxly use it to enter the Dream Realm. Supergirl, Martian Manhunter and Braniac arrive but Nyxly blasts them aside with the Lexosuit gauntlet and leaps through a transmatter portal, which disgorges a Nightmare monster. Supergirl and Manhunter try to battle the creature, which grows to giant size and heads for a nuclear power plant. They contact Alex and Lena, and Lena does the only thing she can think of: She uses an old DEO satellite to surround part of the city with a dome-shaped force-field, cutting the monster off from the power plant. Trapped inside the dome, the monster turns invisible.
                                            
                                            Nia and Maeve consult the information on the Dream Totem. A tapestry apparently leads the way to it and Maeve explains the legend states the Minoans hid the totem inside the Dream Realm, guarded by an Oracle that ensures only the pure of heart can touch it. The search apparently begins in a forest, possibly the one Nia has been dreaming about. Nia decides to take Maeve there with her.

Their only chance is to use the equipment from the institute to reopen the portal and send the monster back. Kara meets with William to practice for the interview. They see a news report where Governor Peña demands the Superfriends take down the dome. William tells Kara that the dome has cut people off from their places of work and their families. Andrea tells Kara she has set up an interview with the Kaznian chief negotiator for her.

Nia uses dream energy to levitate them and they see a gold spire.

A mob tries to break out of the dome and Kara abandons the interview to talk them down as Supergirl. Andrea tells her she's given her a lot of leeway but her work is suffering from whatever else she has going on. William comes to the Tower and tries to get Supergirl to make a statement calming the public but she has to leave to be at the interview with the leaders as Kara.

Maeve runs past her and tries to grab the totem but the Oracle rejects her for trying to steal her sister's place. The sisters argue: Maeve is still bitter that she spent her whole life studying for something she was passed over for, while Dreamer thinks she doesn't deserve the powers if she would put everyone at risk to get them. Nyxly arrives and blasts the pair before using the gauntlet to override the Oracle's ward and take the totem. Dreamer protects Maeve and battles Nyxly. Maeve gives her the necklace which boosts her powers and allows her to win. Nyxly retreats with the totem.

Kara's friends are ready with the dream portal, which the monster will be attracted to, but she insists on joining them as Supergirl. Sentinel, Martian Manhunter, Lena and Braniac activate the portal and the monster heads for it but is distracted by an attack by military helicopters. Supergirl and Martian Manhunter try to fend off the attack, which also damages the portal pillars. Sentinel and Braniac realign them and Lena brings the portal back online. Supergirl pushes the monster through it. She returns to the interview with Kara but the world leaders have already left. Brainy calls her to tell her about Nyxly getting the Dream Totem.

Nia isn't ready to forgive her sister but does offer her a second chance. Maeve gives her Isabel's necklace and Nia tells her to call their father.

Andrea tells Kara she's rearranged the interview. Kara says to get William to do it and she's also passed on her other articles: She's realised she's not giving CatCo her full attention so quits. She then rejoins William as Supergirl, saying she's ready to give the statement. Lena, Alex and J'onn discuss protecting the other totems at the Tower and see William broadcast Supergirl apologising to the city and vowing to stop Nyxly.

The site chosen is Lover's Lane, where Alex and Kelly share a brief chat before Nyxly arrives and takes the fake totem. The Superfriends emerge and Lena uses a magic circle to stop Nyxly using totem power against them. Nyxly opens up with the gauntlet but a rapid exchange of fire sees Supergirl and Martian Manhunter team up to take her down. Just as Brainiac is about to put her in containment, Lex arrives, hitting the heroes with a blast of kryptonite. The fake totem bursts into flames and Lex and Nyxly teleport out.

Lex complains to Otis, who suggests he just tell Nyxly how he feels. Lex feels that will scare her off. He decides to instead feed her information on the Love Totem via a captive Mitch, telling him not to tell Nyxly where the information comes from. Mitch tells Nyxly he has tracked the Love Totem to a church in Lisbon. Nia dreams the same thing.

Brainiac checks out the scene and notes there are stories that the totem appears and disappears depending on whether those nearby are feeling love or hate.
                                              
                                              Nyxly goes to see Lex and asks for his help. He shows that he has repaired her crystal ball using technology and help from her future self. Nyxly asks what she will be like and Lex tells she achieves her revenge, which may be why she was more receptive to him. Meanwhile, Supergirl and J'onn discuss their experiences with the totems and decide they need to use them as weapons after all. Supergirl asks Lena to use magic to protect her from the Humanity Totem, saying she's scared of ending up with Nyxly, just as Lena is scared of ending up like Lex, but they have to remember who their real family is.
                                              
                                              William asks Alex about her proposal. Alex notes both she and Kelly have been engaged before: Her last proposal was spontaneous but the relationship didn't last. William convinces her that her and Kelly's love is strong. Alex goes to the bar and finds Kelly and Esme there already: Kelly made the booking, with William's help, since she saw the same significance in the date. She takes out a ring to propose and Alex goes to do the same, only to find the Love Totem there. Lex and Nyxly arrive, closely followed by Supergirl and Martian Manhunter, who battle the pair while Alex and Kelly take Esme to safety. Lex has a chance to grab the Love Totem, but with Nyxly facing an attack from Supergirl, Martian Manhunter and a newly-arrived Brainiac, Lex instead grabs her and teleports away.
                                              
                                              J'onn examines the Love Totem, destroyed by a blast from the Courage Totem. Kelly wonders if that means the love in the world will be diminished. Alex doesn't think so, because she still feels love for all of them, and now knows the perfect proposal doesn't matter. She produces the ring and proposes to Kelly, who accepts. Supergirl, J'onn, Brainy and Esme all congratulate them.
                                              
                                              Lex purges Nyxly of the effects of the totem. She asks him why he saved her instead of getting the totem. Lex first tries to claim he didn't know it was there, then admits he loves her, even though he never loves anyone and thought he was destined to live his life alone. He knows she isn't there yet. Nyxly agrees but says she's willing to be friends.
                                              
                                              At the Tower, Kara, J'onn, Esme and Nia celebrate Alex and Kelly's engagement with them. Nia notices Brainy slipping away and follows him. He is confused by Lex's change of behaviour and admits they need to know what happened in the future. Nia tells him it'll be different this time since he isn't keeping secrets and convince him to contact the Legion. Lena arrives and Kara thanks her for protecting her. Lena thanks Kara for helping her be finally free of Lex.
                                              
                                              William ignores a call from Andrea and meets with Otis. Andrea declares she's going to get the evidence herself: She breaks into Luthor Mansion as Acrata and takes Lex's journal. Nyxly tells Lex they can't form the Allstone without the Hope Totem. Lex reveals he already has it: The shell can be destroyed but the essence remains, meaning the Love Totem will also reform. Esme is relaxing at home with Alex and Kelly: None of them notice the image of the Love Totem forming on the back of her neck.</div>

                                              <h1>Supergirl: Season 6: Episode 18: "Truth or Consquences"</h1>
                                              <div class="box">At the Tower, William informs Supergirl, J'onn, Alex, Lena and Dreamer that he received word from Otis that Lex has built Nyxly a Lexosuit. Although they're suspicious, Lena offers to write a programme to track them, while Dreamer offers to try and use the Dream Totem. Alex gets a text from Kelly saying there's a problem with Esme at school. Their attention is drawn to a news programme where the presenters, Derek and Dana, make fun of some love poetry Lex wrote to Nyxly, supposedly published by William. The programme is also viewed by Lex, Nyxly and Mitch: Lex is particularly unamused.

                                                William confronts Andrea about using his name to authenticate the story, stolen from Lex's journals. Andrea argues that William wanted proof but William feels that by turning Lex and Nyxly into figures of fun, she is risking people forgetting how dangerous they are. He also accuses her of not caring about anything other than being number one, rather than using CatCo as a force for good.
                                                
                                                Brainiac communicates with the Legion via his ship. He is evasive about the news he receives but tells Supergirl and the others about Lex and Nyxly using the All Stone to rule the universe in the future and how Nyxly was killed in a battle with the Legion. Meanwhile, Lex and Nyxly track down the Truth Totem, while Lena detects their position. Nyxly enters the totem's gauntlet and attempts to speak truths to pass the test: First that she wants justice on all those who have hurt her, then that she fears the parts of her that resemble her father. Finally, she admits she doesn't like being alone and wishes she had someone she could trust. As she passes the gauntlet, Supergirl, Martian Manhunter, Brainiac and Dreamer arrive and Supergirl is shocked to see the duo have the Hope Totem. Nyxyly opens up a portal to the Dream Realm but Brainiac manages to grab the Dream Totem off her before they're sucked through, with Dreamer then portalling them back to the Tower.
                                                
                                                The group are forced to acknowledge that the Totems can't be destroyed and just reconstitute in a different form. They suggest Brainiac contact the Legion for help. Brainiac instead speaks to his counterpart and explains he is needed to return to the 31st century in order to merge with the Big Brain, an act that will cause him to cease to exist. Dreamer also learns this while using the Dream Totem. Brainiac explains his species will die out if he doesn't go back, and Dreamer can't go with him because history needs her there.
                                                
                                                Kelly and Alex clean up Esme, who relates how a classmate mocked her chocolate roulade during baking, causing her powers to go wild and blow paint everywhere. They notice the love symbol on her neck and take her to the Tower for tests. Supergirl briefly chats with Esme, before suggesting to Alex that something similar to the power-dampening glasses she wore as a child might help Esme feel more comfortable. Alex says things are different now and the world is more accepting of aliens; Esme needs to learn to control her powers but shouldn't have to hide who she is to fit in. When Supergirl presses the point, Alex firmly insists that she doesn't want parenting advice.
                                                
                                                Nyxly uses the Truth Totem on Lex, who reiterates that he wants to rule by her side, not betray her. Supergirl talks with J'onn about her fight with Alex and is reminded that she has to let Alex and Kelly parent Esme how she wants. William finds Esme playing hide and seek in J'onn's office. Andrea contacts Lena and asks if she is a narcissistic monster. Lena says using William's name to publish Lex's journal wasn't her finest hour but she can change.
                                                
                                                Alex hasn't got Esme's test results but Kelly offers an explanation: A new alien at the school has tattoo powers which Esme could have mimicked. Lena detects Nyxly's ship in orbit and Supergirl and Martian Manhunter head up there. Supergirl is attacked by Lex and Nyxly wearing Lexosuits, with Lex using 31st century nanites to destroy her Kryptosuit. Martian Manhunter battles Mitch and an empty suit. Supergirl grabs the Truth Totem from Nyxly and triggers the ship's self-destruct. Lex portals out with Nyxly. Supergirl and Martian Manhunter follow after Supergirl has grabbed the Hope Totem.
                                                
                                                At the Tower, J'onn gives William a positive account of the day's events: Lex and Nyxly's ship has been destroyed and the Superfriends now have five totems safe. Kelly, Lena and Alex arrive with Esme, who won the baking contest. Kelly says she'll have to miss the party because there's no babysitter but William volunteers to look after Esme. At a bunker in Italy, Mitch ruminates on being free now he has no ship. Lex sends him away. Nyxly asks Lex to stay with her, saying she's tired of being alone and running out of reasons not to trust him. Her crystal ball shows her where the Love Totem is and she ponders if it's because she's starting to love Lex.
                                                
                                                Kara, J'onn, Kelly, Alex, Lena, Nia and Brainy are relaxing at a private club. Kelly and Alex head onto the dance floor and, after some words of reassurance from J'onn, Kara and Lena join them. Brainy is in a despondent mood about having to leave once the current crisis is over but Nia convinces him to enjoy the moment.
                                                
                                                William notices that the Tower's defences are down and sends Esme to hide in the office. Lex and Nyxly enter and Lex holds William at gunpoint while Nyxly searches for Esme. William surreptitiously sets up his phone to record Lex taunting him. Nyxly finds Esme and tells her she's a friend of her mums, convincing her to come with her. She lets Lex know and he turns to go...then shoots William in the chest, saying that's for leaking his journal. He also reveals he set up William's meeting with Otis, and Lena tracking the Lexosuits allowed him to place a trojan programme in their computers that stopped them getting Esme's test results. He leaves and a dying William sends a message to Andrea.
                                                
                                                Alex gets Esme's test results, which show her blood is full of Fifth Dimensional energy. She and Kelly work out that the Love Totem has reconstituted itself in Esme. In her office, Andrea gets a message showing William being shot. Supergirl, Martian Manhunter, Alex and Kelly race back to the Tower and find William dead and Esme gone.</div>

                                                <div class="box">The Superfriends are gathered around William's body, covered by a sheet. A recorded message from Lex confirms that he has Esme and says he will do her no harm (he is wearing a Truth Seeker to prove it). He notes the Superfriends have five of the seven Totems while he has only one: The Love Totem located inside Esme. He tells them to hand over the five and the missing Destiny Totem at 12pm the next day in exchange for Esme. As a safe handover point, he selects a bridge where Fort Rozz crashed, where powers can't be used.

                                                  J'onn starts issuing instructions for Brainiac to search for the Totem with technology, Lena to search for a spell and Nia to try and dream its location: Nia points out that didn't work before but Brainy can create a gauntlet for her with the Dream Totem. Alex suggests using Lena's magic to create a fake totem for the exchange but Brainy points out it won't work in the exchange area and Kelly notes Lex would see through it. Supergirl promises to get Esme back.</div>

She assures Esme she will be returned to her mums and tries to access the gauntlet for the Love Totem but it won't work. What's more, the Love Totem is starting to fade and will eventually find a new host. Lex offers to cut the totem out of her but Nyxly refuses to let him harm Esme. Meanwhile, Acrata arrives at the Tower hoping to save William but soon learns she's too late. She talks to Lena, saying she's a monster who caused William's death. Lena insists Andrea can still change.</div>

Kelly finds a devastated Alex and tries to assure her that Esme only has the totem because of the love they have for her. Nyxly tries to win Esme's trust with a story about how her father punished her for drawing, but the Love Totem continues to fade. Lillian looks in on Lex and is shocked that he actually is in love with Nyxly, an alien. She demands he choose between them and Lex calmly replies that he chooses Nyxly.

                                                    Brainy completes the gauntlet for Nia. Nia worries that she'll see something terrible but Brainy says that at least then they're prepared for it, just as they're prepared for him returning to the future. Nia invites him to join her in the dream. Soon after, they report to the other Superfriends. Nia sensed Esme is safe but doesn't know where she is. They do, however, know where the Destiny Totem is: In the grounds of a cathedral in Prague, near a statue of the Three Fates.</div>

Sentinel then appears and takes the totem from her, intending to give it to Lex in exchange for Esme. Supergirl tries to impress on her what she's seen: Lex and Nyxly too powerful for anyone to stop them. However, Sentinel is willing to risk the world to get Esme back and says she'll never forgive Supergirl if Esme dies because of her. She portals out.

                                                      Meanwhile, Lillian speaks with Nyxly and insists that Lex is incapable of love and is just using her to get to the Totems.</div>

Mitch overhears and he and Nyxly find Lex setting up the crystal ball in front of Esme. Lex approaches Esme with a knife and Nyxly gets between them...an act of love which causes her to pass the gauntlet and receive the Love Totem. Lex insists this is what he planned but Nyxly is disgusted with him and insists they're over. Lillian later finds Lex alone and suspects he has a plan.

                                                        Supergirl fills her friends in on the fact Alex has taken the totems and she doesn't have the heart to stop her. J'onn and Brainy propose a plan: Redirecting a solar satellite to give Supergirl a super-charge from a solar flare. The only problem is it will take six months for the sun to regenerate. Lena protests that it would devastate the world but Supergirl thinks it's necessary. Lena and Dreamer go to join Alex and Kelly.

Nyxly lets Esme go and Sentinel places the box on the ground. The totems burst out of it and combine with Nyxly's Totem to form the complete AllStone. Lex and Lillian then appear and trigger explosives, blowing up the bridge.

The energy charges into Supergirl: It will take four minutes before they can trigger the solar flare. The sun starts to darken. Secretary Brown confronts Brainy with a group of soldiers, who he evades. Supergirl hears Brown ordering reinforcements, Al's confusion at her actions and a girl begging her to stop and tells J'onn and Brainy to shut it down. The sun returns to normal. Surrounded by frightened people, Supergirl apologises.

Esme throws the AllStone to the ground, breaking it in three. Supergirl, Nyxly and Lex all grab a shard. Lex and Nyxly blast Supergirl, then turn on each other. Lena's intervention causes Nyxly to gain the upper hand. Lillian takes a blast intended for Lex and is badly injured. Lex and Nyxly both adopt beastlike countenances and portal out.

J'onn, Kelly, Brainy and Nia join them in viewing a news report: Lex and Nyxly's fight is not only causing them to portal across the city but to drain the qualities the Totems represent from people around them. They suggest using Supergirl's third of the AllStone against them but Supergirl thinks more power isn't the answer and flies off to think. She sees Orlando making a speech encouraging people not to give up, which causes them to shake off the AllStone's influence. Supergirl says she knows what they need to do.</div>
